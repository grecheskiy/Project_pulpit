Our study aims to evaluate breast findings in patients with acromegaly by comparing them to the control group. Materials and methods: Sixty-one patients followed with acromegaly diagnosis and 180 healthy controls were included in our study. Demographic data, laboratory results, Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) scores, and breast density evaluated via mammography, malign and benign breast lesions evaluated via mammography, breast ultrasonography (USG), and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients were compared to the control group. Results: While BI-RADS scores were similar in patient and control groups, breast density in acromegaly patients was found out to be higher compared to the control group (p = 0.754, p = 0.001, respectively). In acromegaly patients, the breast calcification rate was higher than controls (p = 0.021). t was observed that mass frequency in USG in acromegaly patients increased when GH level increased as well (p = 0.021). No difference was detected between benign and malign breast lesions diagnosed histopathologically (p = 0.031, p = 0.573, respectively). There was not any difference in terms of BI-RADS scores, breast types, and breast lesions in acromegaly patients that were in remission and not in remission (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Benign and malign breast lesions were found out to be similar to the control group, although breast density rate was detected to be higher in acromegaly patients. A regular follow-up is required in these patients via suitable breast visualization techniques considering their age and clinical status due to mass formation risk derived from increased GH level and extreme breast density despite the absence of any detected breast lesion frequency in acromegaly patients.",0

Objectives:: Spinal chondroblastoma (CB) is a very rare pathology and its clinicopathological and prognostic features remain unclear. Here, we sought to characterize the clinicopathological data of a large spinal CB cohort and determine factors affecting the local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients. Methods:: Electronic searches using Medline, Embase, Google Scholar and Wanfang databases were performed to identify eligible studies per predefined criteria. A retrospective review was also conducted to include additional patients at our center. Results:: Twenty-seven studies from the literature and 8 patients from our local institute were identified, yielding a total of 61 patients for analysis. Overall, there were no differences in clinicopathological characteristics between the local and literature cohorts, except for absence or presence of spinal canal invasion by tumor on imagings and chicken-wire calcification in tumor tissues. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that previous treatment, preoperative or postoperative neurological deficits, type of tumor resection, secondary aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC), chicken-wire calcification and radiotherapy correlated closely with LRFS, though only type of tumor resection, chicken-wire calcification and radiotherapy were predictive of outcome based on multivariate Cox analysis. Analyzing OS, we found that a history of preoperative treatment, concurrent ABC, chicken-wire calcification, type of tumor resection and adjuvant radiotherapy had a significant association with survival, whereas only type of tumor resection remained statistically significant after adjusting for other covariables. Conclusion:: These data may be helpful in prognostic risk stratification and individualized therapy decision making for patients.",2023 Apr

A practical thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TIRADS) for thyroid nodules has been proposed to classify nodules of the thyroid gland to solve the problem of nodule selection for fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Real-time elastography and strain ratio (SR) is a method used to assess the stiffness and predict the malignancy of thyroid nodules. The objective of this study was to assess the role of elastography and SR and the TIRADS scoring system in discriminating malignant from benign thyroid nodules. Materials and methods:: From 2015 to 2018 at Cairo University Hospital, a series of 409 patients with thyroid nodules was referred to undergo thyroid ultrasound. Categorization of each nodule according to the TIRADS ranged from 1 to 5. The qualitative elastography score and semiquantitative SR of the nodules were evaluated. Final diagnosis was done by either postthyroidectomy histopathological examination or US-guided FNAC. Results:: Our study included 409 patients with thyroid nodules. Their mean age was 39 ± 10 SD; 36 were males and 373 were females. There were 22 malignant nodules and 387 benign nodules. There were statistical differences between benign and malignant nodules regarding TIRADS classification, SR, anteroposterior/transverse ratio, degree of echogenicity, border, presence of calcification, and absence of halo sign ( P < 0.001). The elastic properties of thyroid nodules proved to be a good discriminator between malignant and benign nodules ( P- < 0.001) at a cut off value of > 2.32 with 95.2% sensitivity and 86.5% specificity. For every unit increase in SR, the risk of malignancy increased by nearly 2 times. Patients with irregular borders had nearly 17 times increased risk of malignancy than those with regular borders. Conclusion:: Elastography and SR proved to be of high significant value in discriminating benign from malignant nodules, so we recommend adding it to the TIRADS classification.",2020 Nov-Dec
4,"Head KJ,Harrington NG,Schnur JB,Margolies L,Montgomery GH",Examining gain- and loss-framed messages in a novel breast cancer screening/cardiovascular context: Does framing matter?,"Objective: Digital mammography can reveal not only breast cancer but also breast arterial calcification (BAC), which can indicate potential coronary artery disease. To explore ways to inform women of their BAC status in the context of a standard mammography results letter, we conducted a preliminary study comparing gain- and loss-framed messages to encourage follow-up cardiovascular care. Methods: U.S. women over age 40 with no heart disease history (N = 227) were randomly assigned to view a mammography letter including BAC information in one of seven ways (three gain-framed messages, three loss-framed messages, one comparison message). Results: Post-test measures indicated no significant differences on BAC knowledge, recall of test results and recommendations, perceived message effectiveness, or behavioral intentions for follow-up. Conclusion: Despite showing no significant differences between message conditions, results supported the messages' ability to clearly convey BAC information and encourage intention for follow-up cardiovascular care. Innovation: This experimental study represents the first published report examining the inclusion of BAC screening results within the mammography letter. It also explored the use of message framing in a dual detection–prevention context and suggests that future work should test the effects of including both framing tactics in messages designed to target dual-focus contexts.",2022 Dec
5,"Freedman BI,Register TC","Effect of race and genetics on vitamin D metabolism, bone and vascular health.","The pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder accounts for an inverse relationship between bone mineralization and vascular calcification in progressive nephropathy. Inverse associations between bone mineral density (BMD) and calcified atherosclerotic plaque are also observed in individuals of European and African ancestry without nephropathy, suggesting a mechanistic link between these processes that is independent of kidney disease. Despite lower dietary calcium intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations, African Americans have higher BMD and develop osteoporosis less frequently than do European Americans. Moreover, despite having more risk factors for cardiovascular disease, African Americans have a lower incidence and severity of calcified atherosclerotic plaque formation than do European Americans. Strikingly, evidence is now revealing that serum 25(OH)D and/ or 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels associate positively with atherosclerosis but negatively with BMD in African Americans; by contrast, vitamin D levels associate negatively with atherosclerosis and positively with BMD in individuals of European ancestry. Biologic phenomena, therefore, seem to contribute to population-specific differences in vitamin D metabolism, bone and vascular health. Genetic and mechanistic approaches used to explore these differences should further our understanding of bone–blood vessel relationships and explain how African ancestry protects from osteoporosis and calcified atherosclerotic plaque, provided that access of African Americans to health care is equivalent to individuals of European ethnic origin. Ultimately, in our opinion, a new mechanistic understanding of the relationships between bone mineralization and vascular calcification will produce novel approaches for disease prevention in aging populations.",2012 Jun 12

Most existing machine learning methods for coronary angiography analysis are limited to a single aspect. Aims: We aimed to achieve an automatic and multimodal analysis to recognise and quantify coronary angiography, integrating multiple aspects, including the identification of coronary artery segments and the recognition of lesion morphology. Methods: A data set of 20,612 angiograms was retrospectively collected, among which 13,373 angiograms were labelled with coronary artery segments, and 7,239 were labelled with special lesion morphology. Trained and optimised by these labelled data, one network recognised 20 different segments of coronary arteries, while the other detected lesion morphology, including measures of lesion diameter stenosis as well as calcification, thrombosis, total occlusion, and dissection detections in an input angiogram. Results: For segment prediction, the recognition accuracy was 98.4%, and the recognition sensitivity was 85.2%. For detecting lesion morphologies including stenotic lesion, total occlusion, calcification, thrombosis, and dissection, the F1 scores were 0.829, 0.810, 0.802, 0.823, and 0.854, respectively. Only two seconds were needed for the automatic recognition. Conclusions: Our deep learning architecture automatically provides a coronary diagnostic map by integrating multiple aspects. This helps cardiologists to flag and diagnose lesion severity and morphology during the intervention.",2021 May
7,"Yang VS,Lim JQ,Tay TKY,Selvarajan S,Ng CCY,Farid M,Teh BT,Chan JY",Clinicopathologic Features and Whole Genome Sequencing of a Primary Osteosarcoma of the Uterus.,"Primary osteosarcoma (OS) of the uterus is a distinctly rare and aggressive disease with fewer than 20 cases reported worldwide. We describe a case of primary uterine OS with rapid development of pulmonary and brain metastasis in a 50-year-old woman. Histopathologic examination of the uterine tumor showed atypical spindle cells producing an osteoid matrix with calcification in keeping with OS. Despite initial response to doxorubicin and ifosfamide, the patient succumbed to brain metastases just 8 months from diagnosis. Whole genome sequencing was performed on tumor and blood samples to analyze genetic alterations in this highly aggressive tumor. A pathogenic somatic missense mutation resulting in substitution of glutamate for lysine at position 653 within the protein kinase domain of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) was found. The PDGF pathway is involved in cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and it has been implicated in malignancy. Crucially, this pathogenic mutation may be amenable to PDGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition, representing a possible treatment approach in this rare sarcoma.",2020 May
8,"Ali K,Lee DJ,Adamson DL,Khan JN",Radiation-induced dystrophic calcification and severe valvular stenosis: the central role of multimodality 3D cardiac imaging in disease assessment and planning of combined transcatheter aortic and mitral valve replacement.,"Cardiac disease after mediastinal radiotherapy can result in progressive valvular thickening and dystrophic calcification with ensuing leaflet restriction and dysfunction. This can ultimately manifest as valvular stenosis and/or regurgitation. We report a case of a 61-year-old woman with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and severe mitral stenosis due to severe dystrophic calcification postmediastinal radiotherapy for lymphoma. She was deemed surgically inoperable due to dense, continuous calcification throughout the leaflets and annuli of both valves, aortomitral continuity, proximal coronary arteries and proximal porcelain aorta. She underwent simultaneous transcatheter aortic valve replacement and transcatheter mitral valve replacement with an excellent technical and clinical result at 7-month follow-up. We also describe the central role of multimodality three-dimensional transoesophageal echocardiography and multidetector cardiac CT imaging in assessing the severity of valve disease, characterising the nature of cardiac calcification and guiding decisions on surgical operability and transcatheter intervention.",2020
9,"Tokuhara CK,Santesso MR,de Oliveira GSN,Ventura TMda S,Doyama JT,Zambuzzi WF,de Oliveira RC",Updating the role of matrix metalloproteinases in mineralized tissue and related diseases.,"Bone development and healing processes involve a complex cascade of biological events requiring well-orchestrated synergism with bone cells, growth factors, and other trophic signaling molecules and cellular structures. Beyond health processes, MMPs play several key roles in the installation of heart and blood vessel related diseases and cancer, ranging from accelerating metastatic cells to ectopic vascular mineralization by smooth muscle cells in complementary manner. The tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) have an important role in controlling proteolysis. Paired with the post-transcriptional efficiency of specific miRNAs, they modulate MMP performance. If druggable, these molecules are suggested to be a platform for development of “smart” medications and further clinical trials. Thus, considering the pleiotropic effect of MMPs on mammals, the purpose of this review is to update the role of those multifaceted proteases in mineralized tissues in health, such as bone, and pathophysiological disorders, such as ectopic vascular calcification and cancer.",0
10,"Lei J,Liu A,Ma Y,Shi G,Han F,Jiang W,Zhou Y,Zhang C,Liu Y,Huang X,Huang H,Chen J",Dexamethasone is Associated With a Lower Risk of the Progression of Thoracic Aortic Calcification in Breast Cancer Survivors.,"Background and Purpose: Breast cancer survivors have an increased cardiovascular risk, and vascular calcification is the pathological basis of cardiovascular disease. Some factors that affect the progression of thoracic aortic calcification (TAC) in survivors are unclear, and this study aims to explore the relationship between dexamethasone or radiotherapy and the progression of TAC in survivors.Materials and Methods: This study included 189 female patients with breast cancer, and they were divided into the progression and non-progression TAC groups. Radiation or dexamethasone doses, and related laboratory parameters were collected.Results: The cumulative dose of dexamethasone was higher [40 (10–180) mg versus 180 (80–270) mg, p < 0.001], and the cycle was longer [4 (1–6) cycles versus 6 (4–8) cycles, p < 0.001] in the non-progression TAC group. The cumulative dose (r = −0.303, p < 0.001) and cycle (r = −0.357, p < 0.001) of dexamethasone were negatively correlated with the level of increased TAC Agatston scores in survivors. Logistic regression analysis showed that dexamethasone was a protective factor for the progression of TAC (p = 0.029, odds ratio = 0.263, 95% confidence interval = 0.08–0.872). However, there wasn’t significant relationship between radiotherapy, radiation dose, follow-up time and the progression of TAC (all p > 0.05). In addition, aorta volume was positively correlated with the level of increased TAC Agatston scores in intensity modulated radiation therapy (r = 0.460, p < 0.001).Conclusion: Dexamethasone is associated with a lower risk of the progression of TAC in breast cancer survivors, and there’s no correlation between radiotherapy and progression of TAC, but the aorta volume may be a predictor of the severity of progression of TAC.",2021
11,"Fang F,Gong Y,Liao L,Ye F,Zuo Z,Qi Z,Li X,Niu C",Value of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound in Partially Cystic Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas.,"Partially cystic papillary thyroid carcinomas (PCPTCs) are rarely reported papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) and are usually misdiagnosed as benign nodules. The objective of this study was to provide the various sonographic characteristics of partially cystic thyroid nodules for differentiation between malignant and benign nodules, including those for conventional ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Twenty-three PCPTC patients and 37 nodular goiter patients were enrolled in this study. We evaluated the size, cystic percentage, solid echogenicity, calcification, vascularity, and CEUS parameters for each nodule. The final diagnosis of all patients was confirmed via surgery. Univariate analysis demonstrated that compared with benign nodular goiters, PCPTCs more frequently presented with calcification, hypoechogenicity of the solid part, hypoenhancement, heterogeneous enhancement, centrifugal perfusion, peak intensity index <1, time to peak index ≥1, and area under the curve index <1 on preoperative US and CEUS. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that heterogeneous enhancement, centrifugal perfusion, and peak intensity index <1 are independent CEUS characteristics related to malignant PCPTCs and can be used for their differentiation from benign nodular goiters (all p < 0.05). Our study indicated that preoperative CEUS characteristics may serve as a useful tool to distinguish malignant PCPTCs from benign thyroid nodules.",2021
12,"Allen BD,Limoli CL",Breaking barriers: Neurodegenerative repercussions of radiotherapy induced damage on the blood-brain and blood-tumor barrier.,"Exposure to radiation during the treatment of CNS tumors leads to detrimental damage of the blood brain barrier (BBB) in normal tissue. Effects are characterized by leakage of the vasculature which exposes the brain to a host of neurotoxic agents potentially leading to white matter necrosis, parenchymal calcification, and an increased chance of stroke. Vasculature of the blood tumor barrier (BTB) is irregular leading to poorly perfused and hypoxic tissue throughout the tumor that becomes resistant to radiation. While current clinical applications of cranial radiotherapy use dose fractionation to reduce normal tissue damage, these treatments still cause significant alterations to the cells that make up the neurovascular unit of the BBB and BTB. Damage to the vasculature manifests as reduction in tight junction proteins, alterations to membrane transporters, impaired cell signaling, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. While radiotherapy treatments are detrimental to normal tissue, adapting combined strategies with radiation targeted to damage the BTB could aid in drug delivery. Understanding differences between the BBB and the BTB may provide valuable insight allowing clinicians to improve treatment outcomes. Leveraging this information should allow advances in the development of therapeutic modalities that will protect the normal tissue while simultaneously improving CNS tumor treatments.",2022 Jan
13,"Karki S,Shrestha A,Shrestha B",Adenolipoma of the Breast: A Case Report.,"Adenolipoma of the breast is a rare tumor classified as a hamartomatous lesion. It is a well-circumscribed lesion composed of adipocytes and other breast tissues. The characteristic feature is a well-circumscribed mass containing radiolucent fat admixed with dense fibrous connective tissue surrounded by a thin radiopaque pseudo capsule. Microscopically, there is a mixture of ducts and lobules with adipose tissue. Ductal hyperplasia, adenosis, calcification, and apocrine metaplasia may occur within the hamartoma. These are rarely associated with malignancies and excision is considered curative. If these lesions are not detected clinically or radiologically, these remain unrecognized. Awareness of this poorly recognized benign entity would help avoid an incorrect diagnosis and unnecessary intervention. Here we present a case of a 35-year-old female diagnosed histologically as adenolipoma of the breast.",2021 Nov
14,"Xue S,Zhao Q,Tai M,Li N,Liu Y",Correlation between Breast Ultrasound Microcalcification and the Prognosis of Breast Cancer.,"Breast cancer is a common gynecological disease, and its incidence and mortality are higher than those of other common malignant tumors. Breast ultrasound technology is a new surgical method, which has the advantages of reducing postoperative complications, improving the quality of life of patients, and improving the prognosis of patients. Breast microcalcification is a new method for the treatment of tumors. Its mechanism is that the proliferation of breast cancer cell walls increases the inflammatory factors in the cancer tissues and enhances the formation of tumors and peripheral vascular thrombosis. Breast microcalcification in the treatment of breast cancer patients will have a more significant impact compared to ordinary antibiotics alone. For this reason, the microcalcification performance of breast ultrasound is worthy of study, and related research on prognosis is also indispensable. The purpose of this study is to improve the understanding of the ultrasound manifestations of breast cancer microcalcification and the prognosis of breast cancer. This article mainly applied statistical analysis as well as experimental and survey methods to conduct breast ultrasound examination on 100 patients and analyzed the ultrasound manifestations of breast cancer MCs from three aspects: location, shape, and distribution. The experimental results show that there is no correlation between the location and distribution of breast cancer MCs and the diameter of the cancer foci, but there is a certain correlation between the morphology (non-gravel-like calcification) and the diameter of the cancer foci (>5 cm). Among them, HER-2 overexpression accounted for 11.9% in the grit-like MCs group and 51% in the non-grit-like MCs group.",2021

First-time seizure needs careful evaluation to exclude the underlying structural brain lesions. Neuroimaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan, are strongly recommended for all adult patients with first-time seizures. We report the case of a 35-year-old woman who was brought to the emergency department because of the first-time loss of consciousness episode. She developed bilateral jerky movements in both her upper and lower limbs. It was associated with frothy secretions from the mouth and cyanosis. The episode lasted for two minutes and terminated spontaneously. The patient was tired after gaining consciousness. The past medical history of the patient was remarkable for anxiety, depression, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. She has undergone multiple cognitive behavioral therapy sessions, but she did not take any psychiatric medications. Neurological examination did not reveal any focal neurological deficit. The patient underwent a computed tomography scan to exclude any space-occupying lesion. The unenhanced scan demonstrated bilateral symmetrical calcification of the basal ganglia. No calcification was noted in the cerebellum or the cerebral cortex. Otherwise, no intracranial pathology was seen. Such findings conferred the diagnosis of Fahr disease. The patient was discharged on carbamazepine to prevent further seizure episodes. After six months of follow-up, the patient did not experience further convulsion episodes. Fahr disease is a rare disorder with a wide spectrum of manifestations. Despite its rarity, physicians should keep this condition as a possible differential diagnosis when they encounter an adult patient with a first-time seizure, particularly in a patient with a history of neuropsychiatric disorders.",0
16,"Amir T,Hogan MP,Jacobs S,Sevilimedu V,Sung J,Jochelson MS",Comparison of False-Positive Versus True-Positive Findings on Contrast-Enhanced Digital Mammography.,"BACKGROUND.Contrast-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM) has been shown to outperform standard mammography while performing comparably to contrast-enhanced MRI. OBJECTIVE.The purpose of our study was to compare imaging characteristics of false-positive and true-positive findings on CEDM. METHODS.This retrospective study included women who underwent baseline screening CEDM between January 2013 and December 2018 assessed as BI-RADS category 0, 3, 4, or 5 and who underwent biopsy with histopathologic diagnosis or had a 2-year imaging follow-up. Lesion characteristics were extracted from CEDM reports. A true-positive finding was defined as a lesion in which biopsy yielded malignancy. A false-positive finding was defined as a lesion in which biopsy yielded benign or benign high-risk pathology or in which 2-year imaging follow-up was negative. RESULTS.Of 157 patients (median age, 52 years), 24 had a total of 26 true-positive lesions, and 133 had a total of 147 false-positive lesions. Of the 26 true-positive lesions, one (4%) exhibited only a mammographic finding on low-iodine images, 13 (50%) exhibited only a contrast finding on iodine images, and 12 (46%) exhibited both a mammographic finding on low-energy images and a contrast finding on iodine images. A true-positive result was more likely (p = .02) for lesions present on both low-energy images and iodine images (31%) than on low-energy images only (4%) or iodine images only (12%). Among lesions present on both low-energy and iodine images, a true-positive result was more likely (p < .001) when the type of mammographic finding was an asymmetry (46%) or calcification (80%) than a mass (11%) or distortion (0%). A true-positive result was more likely (p = .01) among those with, versus those without, an ultrasound correlate (36% vs 9%) and also was more likely (p = .02) among those with, versus those without, an MRI correlate (18% vs 2%). Of 25 false-positive calcifications, 24 had no associated mammographic enhancement; of five true-positive calcifications, four had mammographic enhancement. CONCLUSION.A low-energy mammographic finding with associated enhancement or a finding with a sonographic or MRI correlate predicts a true-positive result. Calcifications with associated enhancement had a high malignancy rate. Nonetheless, half of true-positive lesions enhanced on iodine images without a mammographic finding on low-energy images. CLINICAL IMPACT.These observations inform radiologists’ management of abnormalities detected on screening CEDM.",2022 May
17,"Jin Y,Bi L,Yang R,Jiang T,Zhang X,Li S",Breast osteosarcoma originating from a malignant phyllodes tumor: A case report of a rare neoplasm.,"Rationale:: Malignant phyllodes tumors with osteosarcomatous transformation are exceedingly rare. The clinical manifestations are similar to those associated with benign giant calcification, resulting in nonspecific and complex clinical symptoms. Patient concerns:: A 59-year-old woman presented with a firm, painless, movable, 5.0 × 4.0 cm lump in the lower inner quadrant of the left breast that she had detected 1 month prior. Diagnoses:: Breast osteosarcoma originating from a malignant phyllodes tumor was confirmed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. Interventions:: The patient underwent a wide local excision. Outcomes:: The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged after the operation. The 6-month postoperative follow-up assessment revealed no evidence of recurrence. Lessons:: Diagnosing malignant phyllodes tumors with osteosarcomatous transformation requires a high level of suspicion and awareness by both surgeons and pathologists. They should be aware of the extent of such disease, which might be mistaken as benign giant calcification. Medical history and imaging findings are important for accurate diagnosis. Phyllodes tumor with an osteosarcomatous component is an aggressive neoplasm associated with distant metastasis. Delayed diagnosis and insufficient excision might negatively impact both treatment and survival.",2021 Nov 24
18,"Gumowska M,Mączewska J,Prostko P,Roszkowska-Purska K,Dobruch-Sobczak K",Is There a Correlation between Multiparametric Assessment in Ultrasound and Intrinsic Subtype of Breast Cancer?,"Molecular profile of breast cancer provides information about its biological activity, prognosis and treatment strategies. The purpose of our study was to investigate the correlation between ultrasound features and molecular subtypes of breast cancer. From June 2019 to December 2019, 86 patients (median age 57 years; range 32–88) with 102 breast cancer tumors were included in the study. The molecular subtypes were classified into five types: luminal A (LA), luminal B without HER2 overexpression (LB HER2−), luminal B with HER2 overexpression (LB HER2+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Histopathological verification was obtained in core biopsy or/and post-surgery specimens in all cases. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between the subtypes and ultrasound imaging features. Experienced radiologists assessed lesions according to the BIRADS-US lexicon. The ultrasound scans were performed with a Supersonic Aixplorer and Supersonix. Based on histopathological verification, the rates of LA, LB HER2−, LB HER2+, HER2+, and TNBC were 33, 17, 17, 16, 19, respectively. Both LB HER2+ and HER2+ subtypes presented higher incidence of calcification (OR = 3.125, p = 0.02, CI 0.0917–5.87) and HER2+ subtype presented a higher incidence of posterior enhancement (OR = 5.75, p = 0.03, CI 1.2257–32.8005), compared to other subtypes. The calcifications were less common in TNBC (OR = 0.176, p = 0.0041, CI 0.0469–0.5335) compared to other subtypes. There were no differences with regard to margin, shape, orientation, elasticity values and vascularity among five molecular subtypes. Our results suggest that there is a correlation between ultrasonographic features assessed according to BIRADS-US lexicon and BC subtypes with HER2 overexpression (both LB HER2+ and HER2+). It may be useful for identification of these aggressive subtypes of breast cancer.",2021 Nov
19,"Zhou S,Wang X,Shi J,Han Q,He L,Tang W,Zhang A",Serum fatty acid binding protein 4 levels are associated with abdominal aortic calcification in peritoneal dialysis patients.,"Background: Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) is an adipokine that was mainly derived from adipocytes and macrophages. Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and could predict their cardiovascular mortality. The pathogenesis of VC is complex, and adipokines may play an important role in it. This study aimed to examine the relationship between serum FABP4 and VC in PD patients. Methods: Serum FABP4 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. According to the median value of serum FABP4, the participants were divided into the low FABP4 group and the high FABP4 group. Lateral plain X-ray films of abdomen were used to evaluate the abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) score. The participants were divided into the high AAC score group (AAC score ≥4, indicating moderate or heavy VC) and the low AAC score group (AAC score <4, indicating no or mild VC). Results: 116 PD patients were involved in the study. The AAC score and the proportion of patients with an AAC score ≥4 of the high FABP4 group were significantly higher than those of the low FABP4 group. Serum FABP4 of the high AAC score group was significantly higher than that of the low AAC score group [164.5 (138.4, 362.8) ng/mL versus 144.7 (123.8, 170.1) ng/mL, p = 0.002]. Serum FABP4 was positively associated with the AAC score according to the multivariate linear regression analysis. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, serum FABP4 was the independent influencer of an AAC score ≥4. Conclusions: Serum FABP4 is positively associated with the AAC score and is an independent marker of AAC in PD patients.",0
20,"Salih AM,Hammood ZD,Kakamad FH,Othman S,Ali RK,Latif S",Paget's disease of the breast in male with underlying invasive ductal carcinoma: A case report with review of literature.,"Introduction: Paget's disease of the breast is a rare cutaneous eczema-like condition that occurs in the nipple-areolar complex of the breast. The current study aims to report a rare case of Paget's disease of the breast associated with invasive ductal carcinoma in a male breast. Case report: A 54-year-old male presented with ulceration of the left nipple-areolar complex that has been progressing over the last 6 months. On examination; there was a palpable axillary lymph node. On ultrasound, a small hypoechoic heterogenous mass was seen beneath the areola (8*4 mm) with surrounding vascularity, and a few axillary lymph nodes with normal morphology and cortical thickness. The mammography revealed some points of calcification arranged in clusters. The patient underwent left side mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The result of histopathological examination showed left side unifocal invasive ductal carcinoma. Discussion: There are two main theories that explain the histogenesis of Paget's disease of the breast with and without underlying malignancy: epidermotropic theory, which suggests an epidermal infiltration of the nipple with Paget cells, and transformative theory, which proposes a malignant transformation of normal glandular cells of the epidermis. Conclusion: The clinical presentation of Paget's disease of the breast is characteristic and should always warn the surgeon of the possibility of underlying malignancy.",2021 Dec
21,"Bril SI,Chargi N,Pezier TF,Tijink BM,Braunius WW,Smid EJ,de Jong PA,de Bree R",Arterial calcification on preoperative computed tomography imaging as a risk factor for pharyngocutaneous fistula formation after total laryngectomy.,"Background: Research in esophageal surgery showed that computed tomography (CT) assessed arterial calcification (AC) is associated with postoperative complications. We investigated the association between AC and pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) formation after laryngectomy. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing laryngectomy. AC was scored at 10 different anatomical locations on CT imaging, blinded for PCF occurrence. Association with PCF was investigated using logistic regression. Results: The 224 patients were included; 62 (27.7%) developed a PCF. Moderate to severe AC was widespread in patients undergoing TL; 7.1% of patients had at most mild AC, of whom 1 experienced a PCF (p = 0.05). A higher cumulative calcification score was associated with PCF in univariable (OR 1.11, p = 0.04) and multivariable analysis (OR 1.14, p = 0.05). Conclusion: AC is widespread in patients undergoing laryngectomy and its burden is associated with PCF. Extensive AC on preoperative imaging may be considered a risk factor for PCF.",2022 Feb

Evidence from in-vivo and in-vitro studies demonstrated stimulatory or inhibitory roles in mitral valve prolapse development, aortic leaflet fusion, and calcification pathways, specifically osteoblastic differentiation and transcription factors modulation. Tissue expression assessment and comparison between physiological and pathological phenotypes of different disease entities, including mitral valve prolapse and mitral chordae tendineae rupture, emerged as the best strategies to address miRNAs over or under-representation and thus, their impact on pathogeneses. In this review, we discuss the fundamental intra- and intercellular signals regulated by miRNAs leading to defects in mitral and aortic valves, congenital heart diseases, and the possible therapeutic strategies targeting them. These miRNAs inhibitors are comprised of antisense oligonucleotides and sponge vectors. The miRNA mimics, miRNA expression vectors, and small molecules are instead possible practical strategies to increase specific miRNA activity. Advantages and technical limitations of these new drugs, including instability and complex pharmacokinetics, are also presented. Novel delivery strategies, such as nanoparticles and liposomes, are described to improve knowledge on future personalized treatment directions.",2021 Nov

A qualitative analysis was carried out based on the filter aided sample preparation (FASP) methodology. In the protein extraction process, we evaluated the applicability of the standard demineralization step and the use of a lysis buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and dithiothreitol (DTT). The analysis of fragmentation spectra based on the human database allowed for the identification of 254 human proteins present in the deposits. In addition, the use of multi-round search in the PEAKS Studio program against the bacterial base allowed for the identification of 393 proteins of bacterial origin present in the extract obtained from sialolith, which so far has not been carried out for this biological material. Furthermore, we successfully applied the SWATH methodology, allowing for a relative quantitative analysis of human proteins present in deposits. The obtained results correlate with the classification of sialoliths proposed by Tretiakow. The performed functional analysis allowed for the first time the selection of proteins, the levels of which differ between the tested samples, which may suggest the role of these proteins in the calcification process in different types of sialoliths. These are preliminary studies, and drawing specific conclusions requires research on a larger group, but it provides us the basis for the continuation of the work that has already begun.",2021 Nov

However, not all adrenal adenomas have this typical radiologic appearance. Our aim is to present the radiological features of atypical adrenocortical adenomas with pathological correlation. Methods:: All the imaging from the pathologically proven adrenal adenoma cases in our hospital (Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland) database (from 2004 to 2019) was reviewed. 8 out of 48 cases (16%) had an atypical radiological appearance and were selected for presentation. Results:: Eight cases demonstrated atypical radiological features including heterogeneous density, incomplete washout on post-contrast imaging, the presence of macroscopic fat and calcification. Lipomatous metaplasia was present in two of the cases pathologically. Conclusion:: Adrenocortical adenomas are the most common adrenal mass encountered on CT, however, may not always have classic imaging features. Radiologists should be familiar with both the typical and atypical imaging manifestations of these benign adrenal lesions. Advances in knowledge:: This paper comprehensively describes the atypical features of adrenocortical adenomas with case examples and radiologic–pathologic correlation. Guidelines and an approach to the work-up of adrenal lesions with atypical appearances are also provided.",2022 Jan 01

Materials and Methods: BC and adjacent normal breast tissue samples were collected from 28 patients. KLK11 expression levels were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction for each sample and associations with known prognostic features were statistically analyzed. Results: Although there was slight up-regulation in tumor tissues overall, significant down-regulation of KLK11 expression in tumor tissue was observed in the elderly and in patients with perineural invasion. Furthermore, tumor size, grade, mitotic score, necrosis, calcification, lymphatic invasion, hormone receptor status and Ki67 expression were associated with altered KLK11 level.

Therefore, we designed a visualization positioning technique based on three directions of mammography to accurately locate suspected microcalcifications to guide the biopsy. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients with suspicious microcalcifications who underwent visualization positioning-guided biopsy (VPB) from June 1, 2016, to June 1, 2021. The visualization positioning technique was performed using an electronic ruler to measure the vertical distance from the microcalcification core to the vertical lines on mammography. Results: A total of 133 patients (median age 46 years; range, 22–87 years) who underwent VPB were included in our study. Among the 133 cases of microcalcifications based on pathological results, 104 were benign, 14 were high risk, and 15 were malignant. In 124 (93.2%) patients, microcalcification was confirmed during the first round of VPB specimen analysis. Only 6 (4.5%) and 3 (2.3%) patients underwent second and third extended resections, respectively, as the resected specimens did not contain microcalcifications. Four patients (3.0%) with malignant biopsy results underwent a subsequent operation. Two patients with DCIS underwent mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy because of diffuse calcification. One patient had no residual cancer, and the other was upgraded to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Two patients with IDC underwent breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Conclusions: VPB can be used to evaluate breast microcalcifications when a mass is not present, making it an effective diagnostic technique.",2021 Nov 2021 Nov

However, severe injury can disrupt this homeostatic biomineralization tropism, leading to adverse patient outcomes due to a paradoxical decrease of biomineralization in bone and increased biomineralization in soft tissues. There remains a need for therapeutics that restore the natural tropism of biomineralization in severely injured patients. Bisphosphonates can elicit potent effects on biomineralization, though with variable impact on musculoskeletal repair. Thus, a critical clinical question remains as to the optimal time to initiate bisphosphonate therapy in patients following a polytrauma, in which bone and muscle are injured in combination with a severe injury, such as a burn. Methods:: To test the hypothesis that the dichotomous effects of bisphosphonates are dependent upon the time of administration relative to the ongoing biomineralization in reparative bone and soft tissues, this study utilized murine models of isolated injury or polytrauma with a severe injury, in conjunction with sensitive, longitudinal measure of musculoskeletal repair. Results:: This study demonstrated that if administered at the time of injury, bisphosphonates prevented severe injury-induced bone loss and soft tissue calcification, but did not interfere with bone repair or remodeling. However, if administered between 7–21 days post-injury, bisphosphonates temporally and spatially localized to sites of active biomineralization, leading to impaired fracture callus remodeling and permanence of soft tissue calcification. Conclusion:: There is a specific pharmacologic window following polytrauma that bisphosphonates can prevent the consequences of dysregulated biomineralization, yet not impair musculoskeletal regeneration.",2022 Apr

In this work, we trained six convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect aortic calcifications and to automate the TAC score assessment in intermediate CVD risk patients. Cardiac computed tomography images from 1415 patients were analyzed together with their aortic geometry previously assessed. Orthogonal patches centered in each aortic candidate lesion were reconstructed and a dataset with 19,790 images (61% positives) was built. Three single-input 2D CNNs were trained using axial, coronal and sagittal patches together with two multi-input 2.5D CNNs combining the orthogonal patches and identifying their best regional combination (BRC) in terms of lesion location. Aortic calcifications were concentrated in the descending (66%) and aortic arch (26%) portions. The BRC of axial patches to detect ascending or aortic arch lesions and sagittal images for the descending portion had the best performance: 0.954 F1-Score, 98.4% sensitivity, 87% of the subjects correctly classified in their TAC category and an average false positive TAC score per patient of 30.

In contrast, there is little evidence for endothelial cells playing a role in the disease. The current study investigates cellular functioning and molecular pathways underlying AMC, respectively by, an ex vivo isometric organ bath set-up to explore the interaction between VSMCs and ECs and quantitative proteomics followed by functional pathway interpretation. AMC development, which was induced in mice by dietary warfarin administration, was proved by positive Von Kossa staining and a significantly increased calcium content in the aorta compared to that of control mice. The ex vivo organ bath set-up showed calcified aortic segments to be significantly more sensitive to phenylephrine induced contraction, compared to control segments. This, together with the fact that calcified segments as compared to control segments, showed a significantly smaller contraction in the absence of extracellular calcium, argues for a reduced basal NO production in the calcified segments. Moreover, proteomic data revealed a reduced eNOS activation to be part of the vascular calcification process. In summary, this study identifies a poor endothelial function, next to classic pro-calcifying stimuli, as a possible initiator of arterial calcification.",2021 Nov

Methods: A total of 161 patients with 166 breast lesions were recruited in this retrospectively study. All cases were diagnosed as BI-RADS 4 or 5 by MG and as NML on ultrasound. While all NMLs underwent mammography, target US and ABUS before breast surgery or biopsy in the consistent position of breast. The imaging and pathological features of all cases were collected. All lesions were classified according to the lexion of ACR BI-RADS®. Results: There were significant differences between benign and malignant breast NML in all the features of target US and ABUS. US, especially ABUS, was superior to MG in determining the malignant breast NML. There was a significant difference in the detection rate of calcification between MG and Target US (P < 0.001), and there was a significant difference in the detection rate of structural distortion between ABUS and MG (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Target US, especially ABUS, can significantly improve the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the diagnosis of high-risk NMLs in MG. The features of Target US and ABUS such as blood supply, hyperechogenicity, ductal changes, peripheral changes and coronal features could be employed to predict benign and malignant lesions. The coronal features of ABUS were more sensitive than those of Target HHUS in showing structural abnormalities. Target US was less effective than MG in local micro-calcification.",2021
31,"Zhou W,Li YZ,Gao LM,Cai DM",Sonographic Features of Pure Mucinous Breast Carcinoma With Micropapillary Pattern.,"Objective: Previous studies have mostly discussed the clinical manifestations and prognosis of mucinous breast carcinoma with a micropapillary pattern. The purposes of this study were to investigate the sonographic features of pure mucinous breast carcinoma with micropapillary pattern (MUMPC) and to identify the role of ultrasound in the differential diagnosis between MUMPC and conventional pure mucinous breast carcinoma (cPMBC). Materials and Methods: We obtained written informed consent from all patients, and the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital approved this retrospective study. The study was conducted between May and August 2020. We enrolled 133 patients with 133 breast lesions confirmed as mucinous breast carcinoma (MBC) histopathologically between January 2014 and January 2020.We retrospectively assessed sonographic features (margin, shape, internal echogenicity, calcification, posterior acoustic feature, invasive growth, blood flow grade, and rate of missed diagnosis) and clinical characteristics (age, tumor size, tumor texture, initial symptom, and lymph node metastasis). Bivariable analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0. Results: The 133 lesions included 11 MUMPCs, 65 cPMBCs, and 57 mixed MBCs (MMBCs). There were significant differences in margin, shape, calcification, posterior acoustic feature, invasive growth, rate of missed diagnosis, average tumor size, and lymph node metastasis among the three groups (p < 0.05). The subsequent pairwise comparisons showed that there were significant differences in lymph node metastasis, margin, and invasive growth between MUMPC and cPMBC (p < 0.05). In patients aged >45 years, there was a significant difference in tumor size among the three groups (p = 0.045), and paired comparison showed that the average tumor size in the cPMBC group was larger than that in the MMBC group (p = 0.014). Conclusion: MUMPC showed a non-circumscribed margin and invasive growth more frequently than cPMBC did. Lymphatic metastasis was more likely to occur in MUMPC than cPMBC. Ultrasound is helpful to distinguish MUMPC from cPMBC.",2021

The most common presentation in primary hyperparathyroidism is renal stones, soft tissue calcification, cystic bone disease, and even hypercalcemic crisis. We report a patient who presented with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome due to extreme hypercalcemia (serum calcium concentration, 4.79 mmol/L [2.15–2.25 mmol/L]) resulting from primary hyperparathyroidism (serum parathyroid hormone concentration, 2215 pg/mL). The complications in this patient were complete cardiac damage and acute kidney injury. On the basis of the hypercalcemic crisis, the patient subsequently underwent surgical resection of parathyroid adenoma. Two days after surgery, her serum calcium and parathyroid hormone concentrations were normal. The patient had a good recovery after a series of other relevant therapies.

As a risk factor for tumor persistence and local recurrence, lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) is related to the number of central lymph node metastases (CLNMs). Methods: We performed LLNM risk stratification based on the number of CLNMs for cN0 PTC patients who underwent thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection between January 2013 and December 2018. A retrospective analysis was applied to the 274 collected patients with 1-2 CLNMs. We examined the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients and constructed a LASSO model. Results: In the 1–2 CLNM group, tumors >10 mm located in the upper region and nodular goiters were independent risk factors for LLNM. Specifically, tumors >20 mm and located in the upper region contributed to metastasis risk at level II. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis reduced this risk (p = 0.045, OR = 0.280). Age ≤ 30 years and calcification (microcalcification within thyroid nodules) correlated with LLNM. The LASSO model divided the population into low- (25.74%) and high-risk (57.25%) groups for LLNM, with an AUC of 0.715. Conclusions: For patients with 1–2 CLNMs, young age, calcification, nodular goiter, tumor >10 mm, and tumor in the upper region should alert clinicians to considering a higher occult LLNM burden. Close follow-up and therapy adjustment may be warranted for high-risk patients.",2021

Materials and Methods: Twenty-nine patients with enchondromas, 20 with low-grade chondrosarcomas and 16 with high-grade chondrosarcomas were included retrospectively. Clinical and radiological information and 9 histogram features extracted from CT, T1WI, and T2WI were evaluated. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictive factors for grading cartilaginous tumors and to establish diagnostic models. Another 26 patients were included to validate each model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated, and accuracy rate, sensitivity, specificity and positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) were calculated. Results: On imaging, endosteal scalloping, cortical destruction and calcification shape were predictive for grading cartilaginous tumors. For texture analysis, variance, mean, perc.01%, perc.10%, perc.99% and kurtosis were extracted after multivariate analysis. To differentiate benign cartilaginous tumors from low-grade chondrosarcomas, the imaging features model reached the highest accuracy rate (83.7%) and AUC (0.841), with a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 93.1%. The CTTA feature model best distinguished low-grade and high-grade chondrosarcomas, with accuracies of 71.9%, and 80% in the training and validation groups, respectively; T1-TA and T2-TA could not distinguish them well. We found that the imaging feature model best differentiated benign and malignant cartilaginous tumors, with an accuracy rate of 89.2%, followed by the T1-TA feature model (80.4%). Conclusions: The imaging feature model and CTTA- or MRI-based texture analysis have the potential to differentiate cartilaginous tumors in long bones by grade.

36,"Wang FZ,Zhou H,Wang HY,Dai HB,Gao Q,Qian P,Zhou YB",Hydrogen sulfide prevents arterial medial calcification in rats with diabetic nephropathy.,"Background: Arterial medial calcification (AMC) is associated with a high incidence of cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Here, we tested whether hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can prevent AMC in rats with diabetic nephropathy (DN). Methods: DN was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin and high-fat diet (45% kcal as fat) containing 0.75% adenine in Sprague–Dawley rats for 8 weeks. Results: Rats with DN displayed obvious calcification in aorta, and this was significantly alleviated by Sodium Hydrosulfide (NaHS, a H2S donor, 50 μmol/kg/day for 8 weeks) treatment through decreasing calcium and phosphorus content, ALP activity and calcium deposition in aorta. Interestingly, the main endogenous H2S generating enzyme activity and protein expression of cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) were largely reduced in the arterial wall of DN rats. Exogenous NaHS treatment restored CSE activity and its expression, inhibited aortic osteogenic transformation by upregulating phenotypic markers of smooth muscle cells SMα-actin and SM22α, and downregulating core binding factor α-1 (Cbfα-1, a key factor for bone formation), protein expressions in rats with DN when compared to the control group. NaHS administration also significantly reduced Stat3 activation, cathepsin S (CAS) activity and TGF-β1 protein level, and improved aortic elastin expression. Conclusions: H2S may have a clinical significance for treating AMC in people with DN by reducing Stat3 activation, CAS activity, TGF-β1 level and increasing local elastin level.

37,"Huang Y,Zheng S,Lai B",Analysis of the Mechanism of Breast Metastasis Based on Image Recognition and Ultrasound Diagnosis.,"Breast cancer is one of the cancers with the highest incidence among women. In the late stage, cancer cells may metastasize to a distance, causing multiple organ diseases, threatening the lives of patients. The detection of lymph node metastasis based on pathological images is a key indicator for the diagnosis and staging of breast cancer, and correct staging decisions are the prerequisite and basis for targeted treatment. At present, the detection of lymph node metastasis mainly relies on manual screening by pathologists, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the diagnosis results are variable and subjective. The automatic staging method based on the panoramic image calculation of the sentinel lymph node of the breast proposed in this paper can provide a set of standardized, high-accuracy, and repeatable objective diagnosis results. However, it is very difficult to automatically detect and locate cancer metastasis areas in highly complex panoramic images of lymph nodes. This paper proposes a novel deep network training strategy based on the sliding window to train an automatic localization model of cancer metastasis area. The training strategy first trains the initial convolutional network in a small amount of data, extracts false-positive and false-negative image blocks, and uses manual screening combined with automatic network screening to reclassify the false-positive blocks to improve the class of negative categories. Using mammography, ultrasound, MRI, and 18F-FDG PET-CT examinations, the detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of primary cancers in the breast of patients with axillary lymph node metastasis as the first diagnosis were obtained. The detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI for primary cancers in the breast are much higher than those of X-ray, ultrasound, and 18F-FDG PET-CT (all P values <0.001). Mammography, ultrasound, and PET-CT examinations showed no difference in the detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of primary cancers in the breast of patients with axillary lymph node metastasis as the first diagnosis. Breast MRI should be used as a routine examination for patients with axillary lymph node metastasis as the first diagnosis. The primary breast cancer in the first diagnosed patients with axillary lymph node metastasis is often presented as localized asymmetric compactness or calcification on X-ray; it often appears as small focal mass lesions and ductal lesions without three-dimensional space-occupying effect on ultrasound.",2021

The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model for positive margins based on risk factors available before surgery. Methods: Patients undergoing BCS for in situ or invasive cancer between 2015 and 2016 at site A formed a development cohort; those operated during 2017 in site A and B formed two validation cohorts. MRI was not used routinely. Preoperative radiographic and tumour characteristics and method of operation were collected from patient charts. Multivariable logistic regression was used to develop a prediction model for positive margins including variables with discriminatory capacity identified in a univariable model. The discrimination and calibration of the prediction model was assessed in the validation cohorts, and a nomogram developed. Results: There were 432 patients in the development cohort, and 190 and 157 in site A and B validation cohorts respectively. Positive margins were identified in 77 patients (17.8 per cent) in the development cohort. A non-linear transformation of mammographic tumour size and six variables (visible on mammography, ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular invasive cancer, distance from nipple–areola complex, calcification, and type of surgery) were included in the final prediction model, which had an area under the curve of 0.80 (95 per cent c.i. 0.75 to 0.85). The discrimination and calibration of the prediction model was assessed in the validation cohorts, and a nomogram developed. Conclusion: The prediction model showed good ability to predict positive margins after BCS and might, after further validation, be used before surgery in centres without the routine use of preoperative MRI.Presented in part to the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, San Antonio, Texas, USA, December 2018 and the Swedish Surgical Society Annual Meeting, Helsingborg, Sweden, August 2018.",2021 Oct

The present retrospective observational cohort study aimed to define the prevalence, progression rate, risk factors and clinical implications of BAC in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients across stages of disease. The presence and extent of BAC were determined on mammograms in 310 females (58.7 ± 10.8 years, Caucasian) with CKD across various stages of disease [CKD G2–5D n = 132; transplant (Tx) recipients n = 178]. In a subset of 88 patients, repeat mammography was performed, allowing us to calculate the annualized BAC rate. Overall, BAC was observed in 34.7% of the patients. BAC prevalence (P = 0.02) and BAC score (P = 0.05) increased along the progression of CKD. In the overall cohort, patients with BAC were characterized by older age, more cardiovascular disease, more inflammation, higher pulse pressure and borderline higher prevalence of diabetes and were more often treated with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). The BAC progression rate was significantly lower in Tx patients as compared with CKD G5D. Progressors were characterized by more inflammation, worse kidney function, higher BAC score and higher serum phosphate level (Tx only) at baseline and were more often treated with a VKA. Major adverse cardiovascular event-free survival was significantly worse in Tx patients with BAC. In conclusion, BAC is common among CKD patients, progresses at a slower pace in Tx patients as compared with CKD 5D and associates with dismal cardiovascular outcomes. BAC score, kidney function, serum phosphate at baseline and VKA usage seem to be important determinants of progression.",2022 Feb

Results: 52 individuals (26 matched pairs) were included in the analysis. The mean age was 66.4±5.5 years, 44 (84.6%) were men, and the mean aortic valve velocity was 2.80±0.49 m/s. The median Lp(a) was 79 (64–117) mg/dL and 7 (5–11) mg/dL in the high and low Lp(a) groups, respectively. Systolic blood pressure and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (corrected for Lp(a)) were significantly higher in the low Lp(a) group (141±12 mm Hg vs 128±12 mm Hg, 2.5±1.1 mmol/L vs 1.9±0.8 mmol/L). We found no difference in valvular 18F-NaF uptake between the high and low Lp(a) groups (3.02±1.26 vs 3.05±0.96, p=0.902). Linear regression analysis showed valvular calcium score to be the only significant determinant of valvular 18F-NaF uptake (β=0.63; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.88 per 1000 Agatston unit increase, p<0.001). Lp(a) was not associated with 18F-NaF uptake (β=0.17; 95% CI −0.44 to 0.88, p=0.305 for the high Lp(a) group). Conclusion: Among patients with mild to moderate AS, calcification activity is predominantly determined by established calcium burden. The results do not support our hypothesis that Lp(a) is associated with valvular 18F-NaF uptake.",2022 Jan

Thus, this process can be used for the early diagnostics of some malignant ovarian tumors. We compared the results of ultrasound and histology and found that calcifications of a size less than 200 μm are not detected by ultrasound. These calcified structures are round fragile particles of different sizes. In the EDX (Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) spectra, the main lines were from Ca and P, and the ratio of these elements corresponds to hydroxyapatite. Thus, we established that hydroxyapatite is the main mineral component of ovarian psammoma bodies and could be used for early diagnostics of ovarian malignant neoplasia.",2021 Oct

A rigid artery facilitates elastin to degradation by MMPs, exposing vascular cells to greater mechanical stress and triggering signaling mechanisms that only exacerbate aging, creating a self-sustaining inflammatory environment that also promotes vascular calcification. In this review, we highlight the role of crosstalk between smooth muscle cells and the vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) and how aging promotes smooth muscle cell phenotypes that ultimately lead to mechanical impairment of aging arteries. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and the role of associated changes in ECM during aging may contribute to new approaches to prevent or delay arterial aging and the onset of cardiovascular diseases.",2021 Sep

Because of this key role, several imaging probes have been developed for their in vivo identification. Among them, [18F]FNa is the gold standard, showing a large uptake in the whole skeleton by positron emission tomography. Here, we push the field toward the combined anatomical and functional early characterization of atherosclerosis. For this, we have developed hydroxyapatite (HAP)-multitag, a bisphosphonate-functionalized 68Ga core-doped magnetic nanoparticle showing high affinity toward most common calcium salts present in microcalcifications, particularly HAP. We characterized this interaction in vitro and in vivo, showing a massive uptake in the atherosclerotic lesion identified by positron emission tomography (PET) and positive contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, this accumulation was found to be dependent on the calcification progression, with a maximum uptake in the microcalcification stage. These results confirmed the ability of HAP-multitag to identify vascular calcifications by PET/(T1)MRI during the vulnerable stages of the plaque progression.",2021 Sep 29

It is crucial to identify risk predictors for such a phenomenon and evaluate its impact on axillary conditions to help surgeons determine which patients should receive appropriate axillary lymph node management. Methods: Medical records of 260 patients preoperatively diagnosed with DCIS via 14-gauge CNB were retrospectively analyzed. All of them underwent subsequent surgery at our institution and were successively divided into invasive and non-invasive groups, and metastatic and non-metastatic groups according to pathology of resected specimens and metastasis of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). Predictive value of preoperative physical examinations, imaging findings, histopathological findings, and hematological indexes for pathological underestimation and metastasis of ALN was assessed by logistic regression analysis. Results: The concomitant invasive carcinoma was overlooked in 75 out of 260 patients (29.3%). Multivariate analysis revealed that presence of microinvasion, presence of abnormal lymph node on ultrasound, and absent linear or segmental distributed calcification on mammography were independent risk predictors for invasive carcinoma. Fourteen patients had lymph node metastasis, and five of them were in the non-invasive group. The presence of abnormal lymph node on ultrasound and increased ratio of platelet distribution width to platelet crit (PDW/PCT) (>52.85) were identified as independent risk predictors for ALN metastasis. Conclusion: For patients diagnosed with DCIS preoperatively, appropriate ALN management is necessary if they have risk predictors for concomitant invasive carcinoma and ALN metastasis.",2021

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed mammography, MRI, and histopathological data for 377 patients with breast masses on mammography, including 73 benign and 304 malignant masses. Results: The sensitivities and negative predictive values (NPVs) were significantly higher for MRI compared with mammography for detecting breast cancer (98.4% vs. 89.8% and 87.8% vs. 46.6%, respectively). The specificity and positive predictive values (PPV) were similar for both techniques. Compared with mammography alone, mammography plus MRI improved the specificity (67.1% vs. 37.0%) and PPV (91.8% vs. 85.6%), but there was no significant difference in sensitivity or NPV. Compared with MRI alone, the combination significantly improved the specificity (67.1% vs. 49.3%), but the sensitivity (88.5% vs. 98.4%) and NPV (58.3% vs. 87.8%) were reduced, and the PPV was similar in both groups. There was no significant difference between mammography and MRI in terms of sensitivity or specificity among 81 patients with breast masses with calcification. Conclusion: Breast MRI improved the sensitivity and NPV for breast cancer detection. Combining MRI and mammography improved the specificity and PPV, but MRI offered no advantage in patients with breast masses with calcification.",2021 Sep

Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In order to identify novel druggable targets for OA, we aimed to investigate novel molecules regulating the ALK1/ALK5 balance in OA chondrocytes. We performed gene expression analysis of TGF‐β signaling modulators in joints from three different mouse models of OA and found an upregulated expression of the TGF‐β co‐receptor Cripto (Tdgf1), which was validated in murine and human cartilage OA samples at the protein level. In vitro and ex vivo, elevated expression of Cripto favors the hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes, eventually contributing to tissue calcification. Furthermore, we found that Cripto participates in a TGF‐β–ALK1–Cripto receptor complex in the plasma membrane, thereby inducing catabolic SMAD1/5 signaling in chondrocytes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Cripto is expressed in OA and plays a functional role promoting chondrocyte hypertrophy, thereby becoming a novel potential therapeutic target in OA, for which there is no efficient cure or validated biomarker. © 2021 The Authors.

Since estrogen-replacement therapy is associated with increased cancer risk, there is a strong need for safer therapeutic approaches. In this study we aimed to investigate the protective and therapeutic effects of the phytoestrogen resveratrol against vascular calcification in ovariectomized rats, a preclinical model of postmenopause. Furthermore, we aimed to compare the effects of resveratrol to those of estrogen and to explore the mechanisms underpinning those effects. Treatment with resveratrol or estrogen ameliorated aortic calcification in ovariectomized rats, as shown by reduced calcium deposition in the arterial wall. Mechanistically, the effects of resveratrol and estrogen were mediated via the activation of SIRT1 signaling. SIRT1 protein expression was downregulated in the aortas of ovariectomized rats, and upregulated in rats treated with resveratrol or estrogen. Moreover, resveratrol and estrogen reduced the levels of the osteogenic markers: runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) which have been shown to play a role during vascular calcification. Additionally, the senescence markers (p53, p16 and p21) which were also reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification, were reduced upon treatment with resveratrol and estrogen. In conclusion, the phytoestrogen resveratrol may be a safer alternative to estrogen, as a therapeutic approach against the progression of vascular calcification during postmenopause.",2021 Sep

Then, the ability of these directly converted osteoblasts (dOBs) to produce calcified substrates and the expression of osteoblast genes were analyzed in comparison with osteoblasts converted by exactly the same procedure but seeded onto a conventional atelocollagen scaffold. dOBs exposed to FD-NanoClip in both sheet and fiber morphologies produced a significantly higher concentration of calcium deposits as compared to a control cell sample (i.e., unconverted fibroblasts), while there was no statistically significant difference in calcification level between dOBs exposed to atelocollagen sheets and the control group. The observed differences in osteogenic behaviors were interpreted according to Raman spectroscopic analyses comparing different polysaccharide scaffolds and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses of dOB cultures. This study substantiates a possible new path to repair large bone defects through a simplified transplantation procedure using FD-NanoClip sheets with better osteogenic outputs as compared to the existing atelocollagen scaffolding material.",2021

A misinterpretation of mammography may lead to an unneeded biopsy of the false-positive results, decreasing the patient’s chances of survival. This study aims to increase the probability of early breast mass identification to ensure better treatment and minimize mortality risk. However, this study proposes a deep learning method based on convolutional neural networks to extract features of varying densities and classify normal and suspicious mammography regions. Two different experiments were carried out to validate the consistency of diagnoses and classification. The first experiment consisted of five end-to-end pre-trained and fine-tuned deep convolution neural networks. Additionally, the deep features extracted are used to train the support vector machine algorithm, resulting in an outstanding performance in the second experiment. Furthermore, this study confirms an improvement in mass recognition accuracy through data cleaning, preprocessing, and augmentation. Our deep learning hybrid model obtained a classification accuracy of 97.8%, outperforming the current state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed model’s improvements are appropriated in conventional pathological practices that conceivably reduce the pathologist’s strain in predicting clinical outcomes by analyzing patients’ mammography images. Abstract: Background: Diagnosing breast cancer masses and calcification clusters have paramount significance in mammography, which aids in mitigating the disease’s complexities and curing it at early stages. However, a wrong mammogram interpretation may lead to an unnecessary biopsy of the false-positive findings, which reduces the patient’s survival chances. Consequently, approaches that learn to discern breast masses can reduce the number of misconceptions and incorrect diagnoses. Conventionally used classification models focus on feature extraction techniques specific to a particular problem based on domain information. Deep learning strategies are becoming promising alternatives to solve the many challenges of feature-based approaches. Methods: This study introduces a convolutional neural network (ConvNet)-based deep learning method to extract features at varying densities and discern mammography’s normal and suspected regions. Two different experiments were carried out to make an accurate diagnosis and classification. The first experiment consisted of five end-to-end pre-trained and fine-tuned deep convolution neural networks (DCNN). The in-depth features extracted from the ConvNet are also used to train the support vector machine algorithm to achieve excellent performance in the second experiment. Additionally, DCNN is the most frequently used image interpretation and classification method, including VGGNet, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, ResNet, and DenseNet. Moreover, this study pertains to data cleaning, preprocessing, and data augmentation, and improving mass recognition accuracy. The efficacy of all models is evaluated by training and testing three mammography datasets and has exhibited remarkable results. Results: Our deep learning ConvNet+SVM model obtained a discriminative training accuracy of 97.7% and validating accuracy of 97.8%, contrary to this, VGGNet16 method yielded 90.2%, 93.5% for VGGNet19, 63.4% for GoogLeNet, 82.9% for MobileNetV2, 75.1% for ResNet50, and 72.9% for DenseNet121.

The present study aimed to assess the findings of stress echo in women with BAC.Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on women who undergo mammography for routine breast cancer screening at Imam Reza hospital, western Iran from March 2018 to July 2018. The patients underwent stress echocardiography to evaluate the probability of myocardial ischemia (MI). Chi-square and independent t-tests were used to assess the differences between subgroups.Results: BAC was present in 61 (15.2%) women. The mean age of the patients with BAC was significantly higher than the patients without BAC (58.59± 7.82 vs. 55.32±6.57, p =0.003). Prevalence rates of the menopause (88.5% vs. 71.1%, p=0.009), hypertension (29.5% vs. 17.7%, p=0.032), and hypercholesterolemia (24.6% vs. 13.0, p=0.018) were significantly higher in the patients with BAC compared to the patients without BAC. The prevalence rate of MI symptoms in the patients with BAC was equal to 24.6%. Signiﬁcantly, more women with BAC were positive for myocardial ischemia compared to the women without BAC (24.6% vs. 8.5%, p<0.001). The prevalence rates of the diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and history of CVDs were significantly higher in the patients who were positive for MI.Conclusion: It was found that BACs are correlated with an increased occurrence rate of CVDs. Our results illustrated that the patients who were positive for MI were more plausible to be diabetic, hyperlipidemic, hypertensive, and having a history of CVDs.",2021 Sep

A possible reason is the context-dependent role of Notch in the cardiovascular system, which would require a finely tuned, cell-specific approach. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short functional endogenous, non-coding RNA sequences able to regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional levels influencing most, if not all, biological processes. Dysregulation of miRNAs expression is implicated in the molecular mechanisms underlying many CVDs. Notch is regulated and regulates a large number of miRNAs expressed in the cardiovascular system and, thus, targeting these miRNAs could represent an avenue to be explored to target Notch for CVDs. In this Review, we provide an overview of both established and potential, based on evidence in other pathologies, crosstalks between miRNAs and Notch in cellular processes underlying atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia, heart failure, calcification of aortic valve, and arrhythmias. We also discuss the potential advantages, as well as the challenges, of using miRNAs for a Notch-based approach for the diagnosis and treatment of the most common CVDs.",2021

Despite advances in radiotherapy techniques, the prevalence of comorbidities such as radiation-associated valvular disease is still increasing due to improved survival of patients receiving radiotherapy. However, the mechanisms of radiation-associated valvular disease are largely unknown. CAVD is considered to be an actively regulated disease process, mainly controlled by valvular interstitial cells (VICs). We hypothesize that radiation exposure catalyzes the calcific response of VICs and, therefore, contributes to the development of radiation-associated valvular disease.Methods and Results: To delineate the relationship between radiation and VIC behavior (morphology, calcification, and matrix turnover), two different in vitro models were established: (1) VICs were cultured two-dimensional (2D) on coverslips in control medium (CM) or osteogenic medium (OM) and irradiated with 0, 2, 4, 8, or 16 Gray (Gy); and (2) three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel system was designed, loaded with VICs and exposed to 0, 4, or 16 Gy of radiation. In both models, a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and proliferation was observed in CM and OM. Radiation exposure caused myofibroblast-like morphological changes and differentiation of VICs, as characterized by decreased αSMA expression. Calcification, as defined by increased alkaline phosphatase activity, was mostly present in the 2D irradiated VICs exposed to 4 Gy, while after exposure to higher doses VICs acquired a unique giant fibroblast-like cell morphology. Finally, matrix turnover was significantly affected by radiation exposure in the 3D irradiated VICs, as shown by decreased collagen staining and increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity.Conclusions: The presented work demonstrates that radiation exposure enhances the calcific response in VICs, a hallmark of CAVD. In addition, high radiation exposure induces differentiation of VICs into a terminally differentiated giant-cell fibroblast. Further studies are essential to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these radiation-induced valvular changes.",2021

Of the 14 VKPDs identified in humans to date, 6 play also important roles in skeletal biology and disease. Thus, osteocalcin, also termed bone Gla-protein, is the most abundant non-collagenous protein in bone. Matrix Gla protein and Ucma/GRP on the other hand are highly abundant in cartilage. Furthermore, periostin, protein S, and growth arrest specific 6 protein (GAS 6) are expressed in skeletal tissues. The roles for these VKDPs are diverse but include the control of calcification and turnover of bone and cartilage. Vitamin K plays an important role in osteoporosis and serum osteocalcin levels are recognized as a promising marker for osteoporosis. On the other hand, matrix Gla protein and Ucma/GRP are associated with osteoarthritis.

In this report, we describe a rare phenotype of hydatid cyst in the breast of a 23-year-old female presented with breast mass in the left upper outer quadrant for 3 months with palpable left axillary lymph nodes. Both US and mammography provided a picture of complex suspicious cystosolid lesion with amorphous micro-calcification (BIRAD-4A). Surgical consultation was performed and Tru-Cut biopsy was recommended. Histopathology results revealed multiple viable protoscolices of E. granulosus and suggested the final diagnosis of breast hydatid cyst. The patient returned with ruptured and infected hydatid cyst of the breast and started treatment with Albendazole 400 mg twice daily in addition to antibiotics. Following-up after two months of Albendazole treatment showed a dramatic shrinkage in the size of the cystic lesion. In conclusion, hydatid cyst should be considered as a differential diagnosis of any cystic or cystosolid lesion in the breast and any organ in the body from head to toe apart from the hair and nails. Radiologists should be aware to the benign lesions that may mimic breast cancer to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary invasive procedures and consequent complications.",2021 Nov

Methods:: Clinicopathological and CT data from 57 patients, who were diagnosed with duodenal lipoma at the first affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Zhengzhou, China) between June 2014 and March 2019, were retrospectively reviewed. Data collected included location and size of the tumor, morphological manifestations (shape, density, boundary), concomitant diseases, pathology and gastroscopy results, and follow-up. Follow-up was performed via telephone, and surgical patients were followed-up for recurrence, metastasis and tumor size, and morphological changes. The follow-up period was up to January 2019. Results:: Of the 57 patients with duodenal lipoma, contrast-enhanced scanning was performed in 7 cases. The tumor was located in the descending duodenum in 33 cases, the ascending in 4 cases, the horizontal in 16 cases, and the bulb in 4 cases. Mean tumor size was 13.0 ± 5.8 mm. CT morphological features of the tumor were as follows: tumor shape, round, quasi-round, or oval (n = 42); long strip (n = 3); nodular (n = 2); triangular (n = 1); and irregular lobulated (n = 9). Among the 57 patients, tumor density was homogeneous in 52 cases, inhomogeneous in 4 cases, and nodular with calcification in 1 case. The tumor boundary was classified as clear and with no capsule. Diseases concomitant with the tumor were as follows: gastritis (n = 23), gastric adenocarcinoma (n = 1), and gastric lymphoma (n = 1). Esophageal disease was found in 16 cases, including reflux esophagitis (n = 12) and esophageal cancer (n = 4). There were 13 cases of gallbladder and biliary disease, including cholecystolithiasis and cholecystitis (n = 9), common bile duct disease (n = 2), colorectal cancer (n = 4), lung cancer (n = 2), duodenal carcinoma with obstruction (n = 1), and ureteral space narrowing (n = 1). Conclusion:: CT was an effective, non-invasive method for diagnosis of duodenal lipoma. CT imaging could clearly discern location, size, shape, and nature of duodenal lipomas. Duodenal lipoma can be associated with digestive tract inflammatory diseases and tumors in different locations, and its diagnosis is potentially valuable for their prevention and treatment.",2021 Aug 20

We hypothesized that CT coronary calcifications are associated with cardiac toxicity and may help ascertain baseline heart disease. Methods and Materials:: We analyzed the cumulative incidence of cardiac events in patients with Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer receiving median 74 Gy on prospective dose-escalation trials. Events were defined as symptomatic effusion, pericarditis, unstable angina, infarction, significant arrhythmia, and/or heart failure. Coronary calcifications were delineated on simulation CT’s using MIM (130 HU threshold). Calcifications were defined “None,” “Low,” and “High,” with median volume dividing Low and High. Results:: Of 109 patients, 26 had cardiac events at median 26 months (range, 1-84 months) post-RT. Median follow-up in surviving patients was 8.8 years (range, 2.3-17.3). On simulation CT’s, 64 (59%) had coronary calcifications with median volume 0.2 cc (range 0.01-8.3). Only 16 patients (15%) had baseline coronary artery disease. Cardiac events occurred in 7% (3/45), 29% (9/31), and 42% (14/33) of patients with No, Low, and High calcifications, respectively. Calcification burden was associated with cardiac toxicity on univariate (Low vs. None: HR 5.0, p=0.015, High vs. None: HR 8.1, p<0.001) and multivariate analyses (Low vs. None: HR 7.0, p=0.005, High vs. None: HR 10.6, p<0.001, heart mean dose: HR 1.1/Gy, p<0.001). Four-year competing risk-adjusted event rates for No, Low, and High calcifications were 4%, 23%, and 34%, respectively.

In view of the importance of RNA methylations in the pathogenesis of diseases, this work reviews the molecular structures, biological functions of five kinds of RNA methylations (m6A, m5C, m1a, m6am and m7G) and their effects on CVDs, including pulmonary hypertension, hypertension, vascular calcification, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure. In CVDs, m6A “writers” catalyze the installation of m6A on RNAs, while “erasers” remove these modifications. Finally, the “readers” of m6A further influence the mRNA splicing, nuclear export, translation and degradation. M5C, m1A, m6Am and m7G are new types of RNA methylations, their roles in CVDs need to be further explored. RNA methylations have become a new research hotspot and the roles in CVDs is gradually emerging, the review of the molecular characteristics, biological functions and effects of RNA methylation on CVDs will contribute to the elucidation of the pathological mechanisms of CVDs and the discovery of new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets of CVDs.",2021

We aimed to study the clinicopathologic spectrum of these neoplasms. A retrospective review of all primary laryngeal NENs diagnosed from 2005 to 2017 was undertaken. Mitotic index was divided into < 2, ≥ 2–10, and > 10 mitoses/2 mm2, with a Ki-67 labelling index of < 2%, ≥ 2–20%, and > 20% for the NET grade 1, 2 and 3 categories, respectively. A total of 27 patients were included. The median age at presentation was 60 years; the male-to-female ratio was 8:1. Supraglottis (n = 22) was the most frequently affected subsite. There were 9 NETs grade 2 (G2), and 18 NECs cases. There were no NET grade 1 or 3 cases in our cohort. Among the NETs G2, the morphology was epithelioid (2), plasmacytoid (3), clear (2), oncocytic (1), and rhabdoid (1). Unique ‘glomeruloid structures’ (n = 5), calcification (n = 3), lymphoid aggregates (n = 5), intranuclear inclusions (n = 2), hyaline globules (n = 3), and Leisegang rings (n = 2) were identified. NECs comprised 16 small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and 2 large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. On immunohistochemistry, tumor cells expressed AE1/AE3 (86%), synaptophysin (100%), chromogranin (100%), INSM1 (100%), calcitonin (33.3%). In the NEC group, p53 aberrant expression (87.5%), Retinoblastoma (Rb) loss (88.2%), and diffuse p16 immunoreactivity (66.7%) were additionally observed. Lymph-node metastasis was detected in 62.5% and 85.7%, while distant metastasis in 55.6% and 76.9%, respectively in NET G2 and NEC. Laryngeal NENs are aggressive neoplasms with a high rate of nodal and distant metastasis. Awareness of the wide pathologic spectrum of laryngeal NENs and appropriate use of IHC is needed to render an accurate diagnosis.

62,"Zhou Y,Wei LL,Zhang RP,Han CW,Cao Y",Globular adiponectin inhibits osteoblastic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells through the PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin pathway.,"Lipid metabolism is closely related to the improvement of vascular calcification (VC) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Globular adiponectin (gAd) has been reported to be involved in the development of VC in CKD, but the detailed regulatory role remains unclear. The present study is aimed to investigate the biological function and the underlying regulation mechanism of gAd in the process of VC during CKD. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) calcification was determined by Alizarin Red S staining. Protein signaling related with VC was tested by western blotting. The expression and intracellular localization of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) was detected by immunofluorescence and uraemic rat with VC was established by a two-step nephrectomy. Combined with the results of Alizarin Red S staining, we discovered that β-glycerophosphate (β-Gp)-induced the osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs was significantly reversed by gAd treatment. Along with the VSMCs calcification and the increase of Runx2 in β-Gp-exposed VSMCs, the activities of protein kinase B (AKT) and Wnt/β-catenin pathway were enhanced, but that were counteracted by the exposure of gAd in rat and human VSMCs. After administration with agonists of the Wnt (SKL2001) and AKT (SC79), there appeared more osteoblastic differentiation and higher expression of Runx2 in gAd-treated VSMCs, but showing lower impact in the presence of SC79 than that in the presence of SKL2001. In the in vivo experiments, intravenous injection of gAd also significantly inhibited VC and Runx2 level in uraemic rat in a dose-dependent manner, possibly through regulating Wnt/β-catenin pathway. This study demonstrates that gAd ameliorates osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs possibly by blocking PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin signaling transduction. The findings provide an important foundation for gAd in treating VC in kidney diseases.Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10735-021-10012-2.",2021
63,"Sakai S,Ishii N,Nakamura Y,Matsuzaki K,Sakai S,Kishi K",Complications and Surgical Treatment of Breast Augmentation Using Autologous Fat Transfer and Fillers.,"Background:: Breast augmentation with autologous fat grafting or hyaluronic acid injection requires minimal loss of healthy tissue. With an increasing trend of breast augmentation with these fillers, accompanying complications have also increased. Patients with complications often complain of induration, cyst formation, calcification, and infection, which require surgical treatment. We will discuss these complications and their surgical treatment through our experience of cases. Methods:: This retrospective study included 20 patients who all required surgical treatment due to breast augmentation complications such as induration, cyst formation, calcification, and infection, and who visited us between May 2007 and June 2018. The patients’ ages ranged from 25 to 63, and the mean age was 39.9. The material used for breast augmentation was fat for 17 cases, and hyaluronic acid, paraffin, and silicon for one case each. The results were analyzed through plastic surgeons at our hospital. Results:: We performed a zigzag incision in the peri-areola margin to 17 of 18 patients for complications of autologous fat grafting and hyaluronic acid injection. The one excluded patient required an adipo-fascial flap from an inframammary fold incision. For one patient with silicon injection complication and one patient with paraffin injection complication, each required mammary gland resection. Conclusions:: A zigzag incision in the peri-areolar margin was useful for treating complications of breast augmentation with autologous fat grafting and hyaluronic acid injection. All cases resulted in inconspicuous fine scars, with high patient satisfaction. However, this incision was insufficient to remove injected silicon and paraffin.",2021 Aug
64,"Esposito P,Verzola D,Picciotto D,Cipriani L,Viazzi F,Garibotto G",Myostatin/Activin-A Signaling in the Vessel Wall and Vascular Calcification.,"A current hypothesis is that transforming growth factor-β signaling ligands, such as activin-A and myostatin, play a role in vascular damage in atherosclerosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Myostatin and activin-A bind with different affinity the activin receptors (type I or II), activating distinct intracellular signaling pathways and finally leading to modulation of gene expression. Myostatin and activin-A are expressed by different cell types and tissues, including muscle, kidney, reproductive system, immune cells, heart, and vessels, where they exert pleiotropic effects. In arterial vessels, experimental evidence indicates that myostatin may mostly promote vascular inflammation and premature aging, while activin-A is involved in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification and CKD-related mineral bone disorders. In this review, we discuss novel insights into the biology and physiology of the role played by myostatin and activin in the vascular wall, focusing on the experimental and clinical data, which suggest the involvement of these molecules in vascular remodeling and calcification processes. Moreover, we describe the strategies that have been used to modulate the activin downward signal. Understanding the role of myostatin/activin signaling in vascular disease and bone metabolism may provide novel therapeutic opportunities to improve the treatment of conditions still associated with high morbidity and mortality.",2021 Aug

Adrenal tumors are relatively difficult to diagnose due to the wide variety of tumors and partial overlap of image features. Cinematic rendering (CR) is a novel, three-dimensional post-processing technology that simulates how light propagates in the real world, providing high-resolution visualizations that truly present subtle anatomical details. We retrospectively collected a series of pathologically confirmed adrenal tumor cases, raw data was introduced into the post-processing workstation, and different tools and templates of CR software were used for reconstruction and rendering. Compared with traditional black and white two-dimensional images and three-dimensional volume rendering (VR) images, CR images were more colorful, layered, and closer to the truth. CR has potential in diagnosing and preoperative planning of adrenal tumors, allowing vivid and realistic visualization of tumor location, morphology, different components (solid, cystic, fat, calcification, etc.), the pattern of enhancement, and the relationship with surrounding tissues and organs.",2021 Aug 2021 Aug

Method: Rat VSMCs calcification model was established by beta‐glycerophosphate (β‐GP, 10 mM) induction. The pH of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was adjusted every 24 h with 10 mM HCl or 10 mM NaHCO3. The mineralization was measured by Alizarin Red staining and O‐cresolphthalein complex one method. mRNA and protein expression were detected by RT‐PCR and Western blot or immunofluorescence. Ca2+ influx was measured by Elisa. Result: The results indicated that alkalization induced an increase in Ca2+ influx to enhance VSMCs calcification. Furthermore, the increase of calcification was associated with the expression of KCa3.1 via advanced expression of osteoblastic differentiation markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Runt‐related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). Blocking KCa3.1 with TRAM‐34 or shRNA vector can significantly lowered the effects of calcification in the activity of ALP and Runx2 expression. Conclusion: Together all, our studies suggested that alkalinization can promote vascular calcification by upregulating KCa3.1 channel and enhancing osteogenic/chondrogenic differentiation by upregulating Runx2. The specific inhibitor TRAM‐34 and KCa3.1‐shRNA ameliorated VSMCs calcification by downregulating KCa3.1.",2021 Aug

To effectively assess the level of vascular calcification, the machine learning algorithm can be used to predict the vascular calcification risk in ESRD patients. As the amount of collected data is unbalanced under different risk levels, it has an influence on the classification task. So, an effective fuzzy support vector machine based on self-representation (FSVM-SR) is proposed to predict vascular calcification risk in this work. In addition, our method is also compared with other conventional machine learning methods, and the results show that our method can better complete the classification task of the vascular calcification risk.",2021

The imbalance of pro-inflammatory (M1 type) and anti-inflammatory (M2 type) macrophages contributes to maintaining tissue integrity. Here, we aimed to probe the effect of Magnoflorine (MAG) on NP cell apoptosis mediated by “M1” polarized macrophages. THP-1 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce “M1” polarized macrophages. Under the treatment with increasing concentrations of MAG, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-18), high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), as well as myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes in THP-1 cells were determined. What’s more, human NP cells were treated with the conditioned medium (CM) from THP-1 cells. The NP cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated. Western blot (WB) was adopted to monitor the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Caspase3, and Caspase9), catabolic enzymes (MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5), and extracellular matrix (ECM) compositions (collagen II and aggrecan) in NP cells. As a result, LPS evidently promoted the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and HMGB1, the MyD88-NF-κB activation, and the NLRP3 inflammasome profile in THP-1 cells, while MAG obviously inhibited the ""M1″ polarization of THP-1 cells. After treatment with “M1” polarized THP-1 cell CM, NP cell viability was decreased, while cell apoptosis, the pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis-related proteins, and catabolic enzymes were distinctly up-regulated, and ECM compositions were reduced. After treatment with MAG, NP cell damages were dramatically eased. Furthermore, MAG dampened the HMGB1 expression and inactivated the MyD88/NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome in NP cells. In conclusion, this study confirmed that MAG alleviates “M1” polarized macrophage-mediated NP cell damage by inactivating the HMGB1-MyD88-NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome, which provides a new reference for IDD treatment.",2021

We aim to identify the preparative risk factors for CLN metastasis in PTC patients concurrent with HT. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed the data including the basic information, preoperative sonographic characteristics, and thyroid function of consecutive PTC patients with HT in our medical center between Jan 2019 and Apr 2021. The Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used for comparison of qualitative variables among patients with or without CLN metastasis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the risk factors for CLN metastasis. The nomogram was constructed and further evaluated by two cohorts produced by 1,000 resampling bootstrap analysis. Results: A total of 98 in 214 (45.8%) PTC patients were identified with CLN metastasis. In multivariate analysis, four variables including high serum thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) level (>1,150 IU/ml), lower tumor location, irregular margin of CLN, and micro-calcification in the CLN were determined to be significantly associated with the CLN metastasis in PTC patients with HT. An individualized nomogram was consequently established with a favorable C-index of 0.815 and verified via two internal validation cohorts. Conclusions: Our results indicated that preoperatively sonographic characteristics of the tumor and lymph node condition combined with serum TgAb level can significantly predict the CLN in PTC patients with HT and the novel nomogram may further help surgeons to manage the CLN in this subpopulation.",2021

Therefore, it is difficult to determine how extensive such surgery should be. There have not been any reports about the recurrence of such ulcers years after surgery. In addition, how ectopic calcification should be treated and the need for partial lung resection in such cases have not been fully elucidated. We report the case of a patient who had a large severe radiation ulcer. Case presentation: A 46-year-old patient underwent cancer resection and received postoperative radiotherapy. Seventeen years later, a chest ulcer developed. Computed tomography showed a depression of the lung parenchyma, which exhibited old radiation pneumonitis, and pathological fractures of the ribs around the ulcer. We excised a region of skin that exhibited a clear change in color together with an additional 1 cm around this area including 4 ribs and grossly calcified area. The lung was partially resected because of strong adhesion, and the chest wall was reconstructed. Two small calcifications remained and which required additional surgery several years later. Clinical discussion: Since multiple surgeries were required, we consider that more generous resection margins were necessary from the beginning. Conclusion: In such cases, it might be necessary to perform more extensive surgery that includes asymptomatic calcified areas.",2021 Aug

Several studies have pointed out the potential for use of velvet antler extract as a nutraceutical supplement, among others, because of its anti-cancer activity. The study of antler regeneration and growth allow us to identify the main proteins and regulatory pathways involved in cell differentiation and regeneration. For this purpose, two sections of antlers (tips and middle sections) using ribs as controls were analyzed from a proteomic point of view. A total of 259 proteins mainly associated with antioxidant mechanisms and Wnt signalling pathways could be responsible for deer antler regeneration and these proteins may be linked to human health benefits. Further studies should be focused on discovering which proteins from velvet antler extracts are associated with these beneficial effects. Abstract: Antlers are the only organ in the mammalian body that regenerates each year. They can reach growth rates of 1–3 cm/day in length and create more than 20 cm2/day of skin in the antler tips (their growth centers). Previous proteomic studies regarding antlers have focused on antler growth centers (tips) compared to the standard bone to detect the proteins involved in tissue growth. However, proteins of cell differentiation and regeneration will be more accurately detected considering more growing tissues. Thus, we set out to compare proteins expressed in antler tips (the highest metabolism rate and cell differentiation) vs. middle sections (moderate cell growth involving bone calcification), using ribs as controls. Samples were obtained in mid-June with antlers’ phenology corresponding to the middle of their growth period. Quantitative proteomic analysis identified 259 differentially abundant proteins mainly associated with antioxidant metabolic mechanisms, protein formation and Wnt signalling pathway, meanwhile, the mid antler section was linked to blood proteins. The high metabolic rate and subsequent risk of oxidative stress also seem to have resulted in strong antioxidant mechanisms. These results suggest that redox regulation of proteins is a key factor in the model of deer antler regeneration.",2021 Jul

The aim of this study is to determine the coronary artery calcium score (CACS) prognostic value in patients with COVID-19 using indices such as deterioration in oxygenation and CT images of the chest. Methods: This was a single-centre retrospective study of 53 consecutive patients with COVID-19 in Narita who were admitted to our hospital between March 2020 and August 2020. CACS was calculated based on non-gated CT scans of the chest performed on admission day. The patients were divided into the following two groups based on CACS: group 1 (CACS ≥180, n=11) and group 2 (CACS <180, n=42). Following univariate analysis of the main variables, multivariate analysis of variables that may be associated with COVID-19 progression was performed. Results: Multivariable logistic regression analysis of age, sex, smoking history, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, number of days from symptom onset to hospitalisation and CACS of ≥180 was performed. It revealed that unlike CACS of <180, CACS of ≥180 is associated with exacerbation of oxygenation or CT images of the chest during hospitalisation (OR: 12.879, 95% CI: 1.399 to 380.401). Furthermore, this model of eight variables showed good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=0.119). Conclusion: CACS may be a prognosis marker of COVID-19 severity. Although coronary artery calcification is not typically assessed in pneumonia cases, it may provide a valuable clinical indicator for predicting severe COVID-19 outcomes.",2021

This can be challenging due to limiting factors, and an artificial intelligence algorithm may be a viable option. Objective: In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether combining an artificial intelligence algorithm (support vector machine and probabilistic neural network) and clinico-pathologic data can preoperatively predict lymph node metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Methods: We retrospectively examined 251 PTCs with lymph node metastasis and 194 PTCs without lymph node metastasis. The artificial intelligence algorithm included the support vector machine (SVM) and the probabilistic neural network (PNN). Results: The ACR TI-RADS (Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System), number of tumours, no well-defined margin, lymph node status and rim calcification on ultrasonography (US), age, sex, tumour size, and presence of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis were significantly more frequent among PTCs with central lymph node metastasis than those without metastasis (P<0.05). The PNN classifier revealed an F1 score of 0.88 on the central lymph node metastasis test set. The SVM classifier revealed an F1 score of 0.93 on the lateral lymph node metastasis test set.

To explore the intrinsic factor causing crossed beaks, this study measured the length of bilateral mandibular ramus of affected birds, and investigated the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of normal and affected sides of mandibular condyle. Results showed that the trait was caused by impaired development of unilateral mandibular ramus, which is extended through calcification of mandibular condyle. The methylation levels in the CG contexts were higher than that of CHG and CHH, with the highest methylation level of gene body region, followed by transcription termination sites and downstream. Subsequently, we identified 1,568 differentially methylated regions and 1,317 differentially methylated genes in CG contexts. Functional annotation analysis of Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes showed that these genes were involved in bone mineralization and bone morphogenesis. Furthermore, by combining the WGBS and previous RNA-Seq data, 11 overlapped genes were regulated by both long non-coding RNA and DNA methylation. Among them, FIGNL1 is an important gene in calcification of mandibular condyle. Generally, because the affected genes play key roles in maintaining mandibular calcification, these changes may be pivotal factors of crossed beaks.",2021

The purpose of this study was to provide a better understanding of clinical, ultrasonographic, and immunohistochemical features of breast metastases from primary lung cancer. Methods: This retrospective case series included patients with breast metastases from primary lung cancer between January 2012 and December 2020. Clinical features, ultrasonographic characteristics, and immunohistochemical findings were evaluated in this analysis. Results: In all, 7 cases (mean ± standard deviation age: 57.4±8.3 years; range, 49–70 years) were evaluated. The maximum size of breast lesions in 6 cases ranged from 1.2 to 4.5 cm, while 1 case showed a diffused pattern. Ultrasound features of breast metastases from lung cancer were irregular (5/7, 71.4%), indistinct (6/7, 85.7%), hypoechoic (7/7, 100.0%), and parallel (6/7, 85.7%) masses without calcification. Immunohistochemical staining test was positive for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) in all patients (7/7, 100.0%), 3 cases (3/5, 60.0%) were negative for p63, 5 cases (5/5, 100.0%) were positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), 4 cases (4/5, 80.0%) were positive for napsin A. Conclusions: The ultrasonographic features of lung metastases to the breast are clinically important to understand. A known history of the primary lung cancer is of great importance when evaluating patients with a breast nodule. The presence of an ipsilateral lung cancer, breast nodule and axillary lymphadenopathy should be considered with pathological and immunohistochemical data to differentiate breast metastases from a primary breast malignancy in this setting.",2021 Jul 2021 Jul

Therefore, we established a radiomic signature to predict the CLN status of PTC patients using preoperative thyroid ultrasound, and investigated the association between the radiomic features and underlying molecular characteristics of PTC tumors. Methods: In total, 270 patients were enrolled in this prospective study, and radiomic features were extracted according to multiple guidelines. A radiomic signature was built with selected features in the training cohort and validated in the validation cohort. The total protein extracted from tumor samples was analyzed with LC/MS and iTRAQ technology. Gene modules acquired by clustering were chosen for their diagnostic significance. A radiogenomic map linking radiomic features to gene modules was constructed with the Spearman correlation matrix. Genes in modules related to metastasis were extracted for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built to identify the hub genes in the modules. Finally, the screened hub genes were validated by immunohistochemistry analysis. Results: The radiomic signature showed good performance for predicting CLN status in training and validation cohorts, with area under curve of 0.873 and 0.831 respectively. A radiogenomic map was created with nine significant correlations between radiomic features and gene modules, and two of them had higher correlation coefficient. Among these, MEmeganta representing the upregulation of telomere maintenance via telomerase and cell-cell adhesion was correlated with ‘Rectlike’ and ‘deviation ratio of tumor tissue and normal thyroid gland’ which reflect the margin and the internal echogenicity of the tumor, respectively. MEblue capturing cell-cell adhesion and glycolysis was associated with feature ‘minimum calcification area’ which measures the punctate calcification. The hub genes of the two modules were identified by protein-protein interaction network. Immunohistochemistry validated that LAMC1 and THBS1 were differently expressed in metastatic and non-metastatic tissues (p=0.003; p=0.002). And LAMC1 was associated with feature ‘Rectlike’ and ‘deviation ratio of tumor and normal thyroid gland’ (p<0.001; p<0.001); THBS1 was correlated with ‘minimum calcification area’ (p<0.001). Conclusions: The radiomic signature proposed here has the potential to noninvasively predict the CLN status in PTC patients. Merging imaging phenotypes with genomic data could allow noninvasive identification of the molecular properties of PTC tumors, which might support clinical decision making and personalized management.",2021

However, the mechanism had remained unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which BMSC-Exos inhibit vascular calcification (VC). We found that BMSC-Exos reduced high Pi-induced Runx2, osteocalcin and BMP2 expression and inhibited the calcium deposition. Gene expression of human VSMCs stimulated by Pi or Pi plus BMSC-Exos (Pi + Exo) was systematically examined by microarray technology. NONHSAT 084969.2 and transcription factor p65 expression was significantly lower in the Pi + Exo group compared with the Pi group. This finding indicated that NONHSAT 084969.2 and the nuclear factor-κB pathway might play an important role in VC inhibition by BMSC-Exos. By silencing NONHSAT 084969.2 with small interfering RNA, Runx2, BMP2, and osteocalcin expression was decreased significantly. The calcified nodule content and alkaline phosphatase activity were reduced after NONHSAT 084969.2 inhibition and p65, p50, and IκB kinase-α expression was decreased significantly. These results indicated that BMSC-Exos inhibited Pi-induced transdifferentiation and calcification of VSMCs by regulating the NONHSAT 084969.2/nuclear factor-κB axis.",2021 Jun 30
78,"Chinetti G,Neels JG",Roles of Nuclear Receptors in Vascular Calcification.,"Vascular calcification is defined as an inappropriate accumulation of calcium depots occurring in soft tissues, including the vascular wall. Growing evidence suggests that vascular calcification is an actively regulated process, sharing similar mechanisms with bone formation, implicating both inhibitory and inducible factors, mediated by osteoclast-like and osteoblast-like cells, respectively. This process, which occurs in nearly all the arterial beds and in both the medial and intimal layers, mainly involves vascular smooth muscle cells. In the vascular wall, calcification can have different clinical consequences, depending on the pattern, localization and nature of calcium deposition. Nuclear receptors are transcription factors widely expressed, activated by specific ligands that control the expression of target genes involved in a multitude of pathophysiological processes, including metabolism, cancer, inflammation and cell differentiation. Some of them act as drug targets. In this review we describe and discuss the role of different nuclear receptors in the control of vascular calcification.",2021 Jun
79,"Li H,Ye J,Liu H,Wang Y,Shi B,Chen J,Kong A,Xu Q,Cai J",Application of deep learning in the detection of breast lesions with four different breast densities.,"Objective: This retrospective study evaluated the model from populations with different breast densities and showed the model's performance on malignancy prediction. Methods: A total of 608 mammograms were collected from Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital in Yangzhou City. The data from this province have not been used in the training or evaluation data set.The model consists of three submodules, lesion detection (Mask‐rcnn), lesion registration between craniocaudal view and mediolateral oblique view, malignancy prediction network (ResNet). The data set used to train the model was obtained from nine institutions across six cities. For normal cases, there were no annotations. Here, we adopted the free‐response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curve as the indicator to evaluate the detection performance of all cancers and triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC). The FROC curves are also shown for mass/distortion/asymmetry and typical benign calcification in two kinds of populations with four types of breast density. Results: The sensitivity to mass/distortion/asymmetry for the four types of breast (A, B, C, D) are 0.94, 0.92, 0.89, and 0.72, respectively, when false positive per image is 0.25, while these values are 1.00, 0.95, 0.92, and 0.90, respectively, for the amorphous calcification lesions. The sensitivity for the cancer is 0.85 at the same false‐positive rate. The TNBC accounts for about 10%–20% of all breast cancers and is more aggressive with poor prognosis than other breast cancers. Herein, we also evaluated performance on the TNBC cases. Our results show that Yizhun AI could detect 75% TNBC lesions at the same false‐positive level mentioned above. Conclusion: The Yizhun AI model used in our work has good diagnostic efficiency for different types of breast, even for the extremely dense breast. It has a guiding role in the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer. The performance of Yizhun AI on mass/distortion/asymmetry is affected by breast density significantly compared to that on amorphous calcification.",2021 Jul

With increasing use of non-gated CT scans in clinical practice, the visual coronary artery scoring system (Weston Method) could quickly provide clinicians with important information of CAC for patient triage and management.Methods: We retrospectively studied the available CT imaging data and estimated CAC burden using the Weston method in 493 emergency room or other hospitalized patients. The Weston scores were calculated by the sum of the score for each vessel including the left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex artery and right coronary artery (range 0–12). The primary endpoint was a composite of the major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization.Results: During a median follow-up of 85 months, a total of 25 (5.1%) MACE were recorded and 57 (11.2%) patients died from any causes. Detectable CAC was most common (96%) in the left anterior descending coronary arteries. Multivariable analysis showed that CAC total scores were independent predictors for MACE and all-cause mortality. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that CAC total score ≥5 was the optimal cutoff value for predicting MACEs.Conclusions: In the emergency room and hospitalized patients, the semi-quantitation of CAC burden using the Weston score system was related to the long-term cardiovascular outcomes including mortality. Clinicians and radiologists should maximize the value of non-contrast chest CT images by reporting CAC details.",2021
81,"Vasuri F,Valente S,Motta I,Degiovanni A,Ciavarella C,Pasquinelli G",ETS-Related Gene Expression in Healthy Femoral Arteries With Focal Calcifications.,"Bone development-related genes are enriched in healthy femoral arteries, which are more prone to calcification, as documented by the predominance of fibrocalcific plaques at the femoral location. We undertook a prospective histological study on the presence of calcifications in normal femoral arteries collected from donors. Since endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) participates in vascular remodeling, immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular markers of EndMT and chondro-osteogenic differentiation were assessed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to describe calcification at its inception. Two hundred and fourteen femoral arteries were enrolled. The mean age of the donors was 39.9 ± 12.9 years; male gender prevailed (M: 128). Histology showed a normal architecture; calcifications were found in 52 (24.3%) cases, without correlations with cardiovascular risk factors. Calcifications were seen on or just beneath the inner elastic lamina (IEL). At IHC, SLUG was increasingly expressed in the wall of focally calcified femoral arteries (FCFA). ETS-related gene (ERG), SLUG, CD44, and SOX-9 were positive in calcifications. RT-PCR showed increased levels of BPM-2, RUNX-2, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin osteogenic transcripts and increased expression of the chondrogenic marker, SOX-9, in FCFA. TEM documented osteoblast-like cells adjacent to the IEL, releasing calcifying vesicles from the cell membrane. The vesicles were embedded in a proteoglycan-rich matrix and were entrapped in IEL fenestrations. In this study, ERG- and CD44-positive cell populations were found in the context of increased SLUG expression, thus supporting the participation of EndMT in FCFA; the increased transcript expression of osteochondrogenic markers, particularly SOX-9, reinforced the view that EndMT, osteochondrogenesis, and neoangiogenesis interact in the process of arterial calcification. Given its role as a transcription factor in the regulation of endothelial homeostasis, arterial ERG expression can be a clue of endothelial dysregulation and changes in IEL organization which can ultimately hinder calcifying vesicle diffusion through the IEL fenestrae. These results may have a broader implication for understanding arterial calcification within a disease context.",2021
82,"Novais AA,Chuffa LGde A,Zuccari DAPde C,Reiter RJ",Exosomes and Melatonin: Where Their Destinies Intersect.,"Cell-to-cell communication is a broad and complex process associated with regular stimuli to maintain healthy cell interactions. One of the agents capable of cellular communication is known as an exosome, a subset of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the cell membrane. The exosome contains a wide range of functional proteins, mRNAs and miRNAs, which have the potential to interact with healthy or diseased cells in the body. On the other hand, melatonin also acts as a cellular communicator, produced and released by the pineal gland in a circadian way and also, non-circadian melatonin is derived from the mitochondria of all normal cells. In addition to exhibiting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and anti-aging activities, melatonin has recently been studied by its influence on exosomes. This review summarizes the relationship between exosomes and melatonin in various pathological processes. There is robust evidence that their combination ameliorates inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, hepatic metabolic disturbance, cancer immunosuppression status, degenerative processes like chronic kidney disease, vascular calcification, ageing, ischemic brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases, obesity, colitis, wound healing and even embryonic development. Association of exosomes and melatonin represent a promising therapeutic tool, capable of interfering with basic molecular processes, such as oxidative stress and the inflammatory cascade, which support many pathophysiological aspects of diseases.",2021

These proteins are characterized by a unique helix-loop-helix EF hand motif, and often form dimers and multimers. The S100 family mainly exists in vertebrates and exerts its biological functions both inside cells as a calcium sensor/binding protein, as well as outside cells. S100A11, a member of the S100 family, may mediate signal transduction in response to internal or external stimuli and it plays various roles in different diseases such as cancers, metabolic disease, neurological diseases, and vascular calcification. In addition, it can function as chemotactic agent in inflammatory disease. In this review, we first detail the discovery of S100 proteins and their structural features, and then specifically focus on the tissue and organ expression of S100A11. We also summarize its biological activities and roles in different disease and signaling pathways, providing an overview of S100A11 research thus far.",2021

A BAC mass score (mg) was derived from digital mammograms. Cognitive function was measured at baseline using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and incident all-cause dementia (n = 49 events; median follow-up = 5.6 years) were ascertained with validated ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. We used cross-sectional linear regression of MoCA scores on BAC, then multinomial logistic regression predicting mild cognitive impairment not progressing to dementia and incident all-cause dementia and, finally, Cox regression of incident all-cause dementia.Results: No association by linear regression was found between MoCA scores and BAC presence in unadjusted or adjusted analysis. Women with severe (upper tertile) BAC had a MoCA score lower by 0.58 points (standard error [SE] = 0.18) relative to women with no BAC. However, this difference disappeared after multivariate adjustment. No significant associations were found in multinomial logistic regression for either BAC presence or gradation in unadjusted or adjusted analysis. No significant associations were found between BAC presence with incident all-cause dementia (fully adjusted hazard ratio = 0.74; 95% confidence interval: 0.39–1.39). Likewise, no significant association with incident all-cause dementia was noted for BAC gradation.Conclusions: Our results do not support the hypothesis that BAC presence or gradation may contribute to cognitive impairment or development of all-cause dementia.",2021 Jun 01
85,"Sheng C,Gao S,Yan L,Yin H,Hu J,Ye Z,Wei X",Application value of conventional ultrasound combined with shear wave elastography in diagnosing triple negative breast cancer.,"Background: At present, most ultrasound (US) studies on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are limited to conventional US features, so it is necessary to develop new joint diagnostic methods. The study aims to explore the values of conventional US and shear wave elastography (SWE) in differential diagnoses of TNBC and non-TNBC. Methods: A total of 120 breast cancer (BC) patients involving 120 lesions that were pathologically verified were retrospectively analyzed in this study. All participants had received both conventional US and SWE before surgery. Meanwhile, the participants were divided into a TNBC group or a non-TNBC group according to their immunohistochemical (IHC) results. The differences between the conventional US features (including lesion shape, growth location, margin, boundary, internal echo, micro-calcification, posterior echo, and internal blood supply) and the SWE image features [including mean lesion hardness (Emean), maximum (Emax), minimum (Emin), standard deviation (SD), and ratio to normal gland (Eratio)] of 2 groups were compared. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the diagnosed lesion was calculated by the area under the curve (AUC). Results: According to the findings of conventional US, the TNBC group mostly manifested as a micro-lobulated margin, with a clear boundary and no internal micro-calcification; the non-TNBC group mainly manifested as marginal angulation or burr, and hyper-echo halo in the boundary, accompanied with internal micro-calcification, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05); the internal thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) and resistance index between the TNBC group and non-TNBC group were similar, and the differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05). The findings of SWE were as follows: differences in Emax, Emean, and Eratio values between 2 groups were statistically significant (P<0.05); and the areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of these three in diagnosing the lesions were 0.811, 0.781 and 0.770, respectively. Conclusions: Conventional US combined with SWE can comprehensively analyze the morphological, blood supply, and hardness features of breast lesions, and provide more reliable information for the differential diagnosis between TNBC and non-TNBC.",2021 Jun 2021 Jun

It has recently been defined as a multifunctional protein, given its involvement in numerous physiological and pathological processes, as well as in the pathogenesis of age-related diseases such as osteoporosis. Based on this evidence, the aim of our study was to investigate the possible role of PTX3 in both the osteoblastic differentiation and calcification process: to this end, primary osteoblast cultures from control and osteoporotic patients were incubated with human recombinant PTX3 (hrPTX3) for 72 h. Standard osteinduction treatment, consisting of β-glycerophosphate, dexamethasone and ascorbic acid, was used as control. Our results showed that treatment with hrPTX3, as well as with the osteogenic cocktail, induced cell differentiation towards the osteoblastic lineage. We also observed that the treatment not only promoted an increase in cell proliferation, but also the formation of calcification-like structures, especially in primary cultures from osteoporotic patients. In conclusion, the results reported here suggest the involvement of PTX3 in osteogenic differentiation, highlighting its osteoinductive capacity, like the standard osteoinduction treatment. Therefore, this study opens new and exciting perspectives about the possible role of PTX3 as biomarker and therapeutic agent for osteoporosis.",2021 Jun

Methods: This study population consisted of 2245 women with breast-nodular abnormalities, which were conducted ultrasound-guided VAEB (US-VAEB). Patient’s clinical and anamnestic data and lesion-related ultrasonic feature variables of B3 captured before US-VAEB were compared with those of benign or malignant cases, using histopathological results as a benchmark. Results: The proportions of benign, B3 and malignant breast lesions diagnosed post-US-VAEB were 88.5, 8.2 and 3.4% respectively. B3 high frequent occurred in BI-RADS-US grade 3 (7.7%), grade 4a (11.0%) and grade 4b (9.1%). The overall malignancy underestimation rate of B3 was 4.4% (8/183). Malignant lesions were found mostly in the range of BI-RADS grade 4b (27.3%), grade 4c (33.3%) and grade 5 (100%). Multivariate binary logistic regression analyses (B3 vs benign) showed that non-menopausal patients (95% CI 1.628–8.616, P = 0.002), single (95% CI 1.370–2.650, P = 0.000) or vascularity (95% CI 1.745–4.150, P = 0.000) nodules in ultrasonic features were significant risk factors for B3 occurrences. In addition, patients elder than 50 years (95% CI 3.178–19.816, P = 0.000), unclear margin (95% CI 3.571–14.119, P = 0.000) or suspicious calcification (95% CI 4.010–30.733, P = 0.000) lesions were significantly associated with higher risks of malignant potentials for B3 cases (malignant vs B3). Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that ultrasound findings and patients’ characteristics might provide valuable information for distinguishing B3 lesions from benign breast abnormalities before VAEB, and help to reduce malignancy underestimation of B3.",2021

We investigated the use of CNNs to distinguish between benign and malignant microcalcifications, using either conventional or dual-energy mammography x-ray images. The two kinds of calcifications, known as type-I (calcium oxalate crystals) and type-II (calcium phosphate aggregations), have different attenuation properties in the mammographic energy range. However, variations in microcalcification shape, size, and density as well as compressed breast thickness and breast tissue background make this a challenging discrimination task for the human visual system.Approach: Simulations (conventional and dual-energy mammography) and phantom experiments (conventional mammography only) were conducted using the range of breast thicknesses and randomly shaped microcalcifications. The off-the-shelf Resnet-18 CNN was trained on the regions of interest with calcification clusters of the two kinds.Results: Both Monte Carlo simulations and experimental phantom data suggest that deep neural networks can be trained to separate the two classes of calcifications with high accuracy, using dual-energy mammograms.Conclusions: Our work shows the encouraging results of using the CNNs for non-invasive testing for type-I and type-II microcalcifications and may stimulate further research in this area with expanding presence of the novel breast imaging modalities like dual-energy mammography or systems using photon-counting detectors.",2021 May

CAVD does not have a fully effective treatment to delay its progression and the specific molecular mechanism of aortic valve calcification remains unclear.Materials and Methods: We obtained the gene expression datasets GSE12644 and GSE51472 from the public comprehensive free database GEO. Then, a series of bioinformatics methods, such as GO and KEGG analysis, STING online tool, Cytoscape software, were used to identify differentially expressed genes in CAVD and healthy controls, construct a PPI network, and then identify key genes. In addition, immune infiltration analysis was used via CIBERSORT to observe the expression of various immune cells in CAVD.Results: A total of 144 differential expression genes were identified in the CAVD samples in comparison with the control samples, including 49 up-regulated genes and 95 down-regulated genes. GO analysis of DEGs were most observably enriched in the immune response, signal transduction, inflammatory response, proteolysis, innate immune response, and apoptotic process. The KEGG analysis revealed that the enrichment of DEGs in CAVD were remarkably observed in the chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Chemokines CXCL13, CCL19, CCL8, CXCL8, CXCL16, MMP9, CCL18, CXCL5, VCAM1, and PPBP were identified as the hub genes of CAVD. It was macrophages that accounted for the maximal proportion among these immune cells. The expression of macrophages M0, B cells memory, and Plasma cells were higher in the CAVD valves than in healthy valves, however, the expression of B cells naïve, NK cells activated, and macrophages M2 were lower.Conclusion: We detected that chemokines CXCL13, CXCL8, CXCL16, and CXCL5, and CCL19, CCL8, and CCL18 are the most important markers of aortic valve disease. The regulatory macrophages M0, plasma cells, B cells memory, B cells naïve, NK cells activated, and macrophages M2 are probably related to the occurrence and the advancement of aortic valve stenosis. These identified chemokines and these immune cells may interact with a subtle adjustment relationship in the development of calcification in CAVD.",2021

One previous study reported that radiologists from a population in Asia displayed a low mammographic cancer detection of 48% compared with over 80% in developed countries, and more importantly, that most lesions missed by these radiologists were spiculated masses or stellate lesions. The aim of this study was to explore the performance of radiologists after undertaking a training test set which had been designed to improve the capability in detecting a specific type of cancers on mammograms. Twenty-five radiologists read two sets of 60 mammograms in a standardized mammogram reading room. The first test set focused on stellate or spiculated masses. When radiologists completed the first set, the system displayed immediate feedback to the readers comparing their performances in each case with the truth of cancer cases and cancer types so that the readers could identify individual-based errors. Later radiologists were asked to read the second set of mammograms which contained different types of cancers including stellate/spiculated masses, asymmetric density, calcification, discrete mass and architectural distortion. Case sensitivity, lesion sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and Jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristics (JAFROC) were calculated for each participant and their diagnostic accuracy was compared between two sessions. Results showed significant improvement among radiologists in case sensitivity (+ 11.4%; P < 0.05), lesion sensitivity (+ 18.7%; P < 0.01) and JAFROC (+ 11%; P < 0.01) in the second set compared with the first set. The increase in diagnostic accuracy was also recorded in the detection of stellate/spiculated mass (+ 20.6%; P < 0.05). This indicated that the performance of radiologists in detecting malignant lesions on mammograms can be improved if an appropriate training intervention is applied after the readers’ weakness and strength are identified.",2021
91,"Yoshida M,Kondo K,Miyamoto N,Kawakami Y,Tangoku A",Calcification in thymomas can predict invasiveness to surrounding organs.,"Background: Thymomas are the most common type of anterior mediastinal tumors. Calcification is sometimes observed in thymomas using computed tomography (CT), and it is more frequent in invasive thymomas than in noninvasive thymomas. However, the significance of calcification in thymomas remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of calcification in thymomas on invasiveness to surrounding organs and investigate the characteristics of thymoma cases with calcification at our institution. Methods: We included thymoma patients treated at our institution between 2000 and 2016, and evaluated their characteristics, including demographics, calcification on CT, histology, Masaoka stage, and myasthenia gravis status. The patients were categorized into calcification (C) and noncalcification (NC) groups. Results: Among 51 included patients, 11 (21.6%) had calcification. A higher proportion of group C patients had World Health Organization histological type B2 and B3 tumors (high‐risk) than type A, AB, and B1 tumors (low‐risk; p = 0.0477). The number of patients with Masaoka stages III and IV were significantly higher in the C group than in the NC group (p < 0.0001). The C group patients had significantly higher rates of invasion to the mediastinal pleura, pericardium, lung, phrenic nerve, and chest wall and pleural dissemination than the NC group patients. Conclusions: Calcification reflects invasiveness of tumors to surrounding organs and tissues, and may thus predict thymoma stage and histologically high‐risk thymomas. Calcification in thymomas may also predict the pathological stage and help decide therapeutic methods and surgical approaches to treat thymomas based on the calcification status according to CT findings.",2021 Jun
92,"Tambovtseva A,Gandhi R,Abdelmasih R,Monsour EP,Hamza A",A Rare Case of Sellar Metastastic Renal Cell Carcinoma Mimicking Pituitary Adenoma - a Case Report.,"Introduction: Metastatic sellar masses are very contributing to 2% of all sellar masses, and up to 0.87% of all metastases to the brain. Breast and lung cancer contribute for up to 60% of all sellar metastases but it is important to recognize other cancers that can also metastasize to pituitary gland. Renal Cell carcinoma (RCC) is number nine on that list. Here we present a case of rare RCC metastasis to pituitary which was mistaken as pituitary adenoma to emphasize early recognition and management of pituitary metastases which may result in better patient’s outcomes and prognosis. Case Presentation: 7 2 year-old male with a remote history of left sided RCC presented with worsening diplopia, blurry vision and headaches for 2 months. Physical exam was remarkable for right sided ptosis with right oculomotor, trochlear and abducens palsy. Computed Tomography Imaging (CT) of the brain showed hyperdense sellar/suprasellar fullness. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with and without contrast of the brain showed 2.2 x 1.7 cm enhancing mass in the right cerebellopontine angle with local mass effect concerning for a pituitary tumor. Laboratory work-up was remarkable for hyperprolactinemia 36.5 ng/mL, low TSH <0.015 mU/L, and normal ACTH, FSH and LH levels. Patient underwent endoscopic trans-nasal resection of pituitary tumor. Surgical pathology of the tumor was consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He was discharged with appropriate multidisciplinary outpatient follow up with endocrinology, oncology and radiology. Discussion: Pituitary metastasis is very rare and often mistaken for pituitary adenoma. Only 7% of Pitutary metastases are symptomatic. Symptom presentation depends on the location of metastases. They include diabetes insipidus (45.2%), visual field defects (27.9%), hypopituitarism (23.6%), ophthalmoplegia (21%), headache (15.8%) and hyperprolactinemia (6.3%). Although, there is no gold standard imaging for sellar masses, both thin-section CT and MRI are beneficial. CT is used for visualizing bony destruction and calcification, on the other hand MRI demarcates lesions in that area. Due to its rarity, there is no standardized guideline therapy for pituitary metastasis and it should be individualized based on patient’s presentation, but it should be multidisciplinary approach of surgical resection, postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery, chemotherapy, and hormone replacement therapy. Prognosis of metastases to pituitary is very poor, with reported six to twenty-two months post resection survival. Factors contributing to prolonged survival are younger age, single/small metastases, and locally guided radiation therapy. Conclusion: This case is to shed light on early recognition of sellar metastasis as a challenging diagnosis especially in patients with rapidly growing pituitary mass and neurological symptoms with history of malignancy for better outcomes.",2021 May 03

Methods:: Isolated segments of biomaterials were implanted subcutaneously in young rats. The study groups received 500 mg phenytoin per kilogram of diet per day. After 90 days, samples were collected and quantitative calcification assessment by optical microscopy, radiological studies with mammography, and atomic emission spectrometry were performed. Results:: Inflammatory reaction was a frequent finding in all groups when analyzed by optical microscopy. The calcium level assessed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry was significantly lower in the study groups using phenytoin compared to the control groups (control bovine pericardium group X=0.254±0.280 µg/mg; study bovine pericardium group X=0.063±0.025 µg/mg; control porcine aortic leaflets group X=0.640±0.226 µg/mg; study porcine aortic leaflets group X=0.056±0.021 µg/mg; P<0.05). Radiologic studies revealed a statistically significant difference between the groups treated with and without phenytoin (not only regarding the bovine pericardium but also the porcine leaflets). Conclusion:: The results obtained suggest that phenytoin reduces the calcification process of bovine pericardium segments and porcine aortic leaflets in subdermal implants in rats; also, the incidence of calcification in bovine pericardium grafts was similar to that of porcine aortic leaflets.",2021 May-Jun 2021 May-Jun

Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide quantitative information regarding the morphology and textural features of lesions. This study attempted to use AI to evaluate the ultrasonic images of PTs and FAs and to explore the diagnostic performance of AI features in the differential diagnosis of PTs and FAs. Methods: A total of 40 PTs and 290 FAs <5 cm in maximum diameter found in female patients were retrospectively analyzed. All tumors were segmented by doctors, and the features of the lesions were collated, including circularity, height-to-width ratio, margin spicules, margin coarseness (MC), margin indistinctness, margin lobulation (ML), internal calcification, angle between the long axis of the lesion and skin, energy, grey entropy, and grey mean. The differences between PTs and FAs were analyzed, and the diagnostic performance of AI features in the differential diagnosis of PTs and FAs was evaluated. Results: Statistically significant differences (P<0.05) were found in the height-to-width ratio, ML, energy, and grey entropy between the PTs and FAs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of single features showed that the area under the curve [(AUC) 0.759] of grey entropy was the largest among the four features with statistically significant differences, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 0.925, 0.459, 0.978, and 0.190, respectively. When considering the combinations of the features, the combination of height-to-width ratio, margin indistinctness, ML, energy, grey entropy, and internal calcification was the most optimal of the combinations of features with an AUC of 0.868, and a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.734, 0.900, 0.982, and 0.316, respectively. Conclusions: Quantitative analysis of AI can identify subtle differences in the morphology and textural features between small PTs and FAs. Comprehensive consideration of multiple features is important for the differential diagnosis of PTs and FAs.",2021 May 2021 May

Patients with KS are usually diagnosed during childhood (early onset of the disease), and the major traits include abnormal calcification of cartilaginous tissues resulting in or associated with malformations of skeletal tissues (e.g., midface hypoplasia and brachytelephalangism) and cardiovascular defects (e.g., congenital heart defect, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, and, in some cases, arterial calcification), and also hearing loss and mild developmental delay. While studies on Mgp–/– mouse, a faithful model of KS, show that pathologic mineral deposition (ectopic calcification) in cartilaginous and vascular tissues is the primary cause underlying many of these abnormalities, the mechanisms explaining how MGP prevents abnormal calcification remain poorly understood. This has negative implication for the development of a cure for KS.

96,"Song X,Li P,Li Y,Yan X,Yuan L,Zhao C,An Y,Chang X",Strong association of glaucoma with atherosclerosis.,"Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) catalyze the synthesis of HCO3- from H2O and CO2. The dysfunction of CAs leads to aqueous humor secretion and high intraocular pressure to cause glaucoma pathogenesis. Methazolamide (MTZ), a CA inhibitor, can effectively treat glaucoma by reducing aqueous humor secretion. We previously reported that carbonic anhydrase I (CA1), a CA family member, was highly expressed in atherosclerotic tissues of the aorta and stimulated atherosclerosis (AS) by promoting calcification. MTZ showed therapeutic and preventive effects on AS in a mouse model. The above findings suggest a relationship between AS and glaucoma. This study explored the possible association between AS prevalence and glaucoma prevalence and the therapeutic effect of MTZ on AS by analyzing medical records. Among 10,751 patients with a primary diagnosis of glaucoma, 699 (6.5%) were also diagnosed with AS. However, the incidences of AS in patients with keratitis and scleritis, which are also ophthalmic diseases, were 2.5% (206/8383 patients) and 3.5% (46/1308 patients), respectively. In the population without ophthalmic records, the AS prevalence was only 1.9% (99,416/5,168,481 patients) (all p values between each group were below 0.001). Among 152,425 patients with a primary diagnosis of AS, 1245 (0.82%) were also diagnosed with glaucoma. Among 199,782 patients with a primary diagnosis of hypertension (excluding AS), 1149 (0.57%) were diagnosed with glaucoma, and among 5,313,433 patients without AS or hypertension, 9513 (0.18%) were diagnosed with glaucoma (all p values between each group were below 0.001). Additionally, among 14 patients who suffered from both AS and glaucoma and were treated with MTZ to cure their glaucoma, 9 of them showed reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, the main index of AS, within 3 months after medication use (2.81 ± 0.61 mmol/L vs. 2.38 ± 0.58 mmol/L, p = 0.039). The above findings demonstrated a strong relation between AS and glaucoma and suggested that AS patients with glaucoma were more likely to suffer from angle-closure glaucoma.",2021

Advanced technologies based on X-ray imaging provide markedly easier ways to control insect infestation of stored products, regardless of whether the quality features are visible on the surface of the grains. Here, we applied contrast enhancement algorithms based on peripheral equalization and calcification emphasis on X-ray images to improve the detection of Sitophilus zeamais in maize grains. In addition, we proposed an approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identity non-infested and infested classes using three different architectures; (i) Inception-ResNet-v2, (ii) Xception and (iii) MobileNetV2. In general, the prediction models developed based on the MobileNetV2 and Xception architectures achieved higher accuracy (≥0.88) in identifying non-infested grains and grains infested by maize weevil, with a correct classification from 0.78 to 1.00 for validation and test sets. Hence, the proposed approach using enhanced radiographs has the potential to provide precise control of Sitophilus zeamais for safe human consumption of maize grains. The proposed method can automatically recognize food contaminated with hidden storage pests without manual features, which makes it more reliable for grain inspection.",2021 Apr

It has excellent antioxidant properties and anti-inflammatory activity and is very effective as an anti-cancer agent against various types of tumors, both in vivo and in vitro. Quercetin has been also reported to modulate the activity of some members of the multidrug-resistance transporters family, such as P-gp, ABCC1, ABCC2, and ABCG2, and the activity of ecto-5′-nucleotidase (NT5E/CD73), a key regulator in some tumor processes such as invasion, migration, and metastasis. In this study, we investigated the effect of Quercetin on ABCC6 expression in HepG2 cells. ABCC6 is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, poorly involved in drug resistance, whose mutations cause pseudoxanthoma elasticum, an inherited disease characterized by ectopic calcification of soft connective tissues. Recently, it has been reported that ABCC6 contributes to cytoskeleton rearrangements and HepG2 cell motility through purinergic signaling. Gene and protein expression were evaluated by quantitative Reverse-Transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot, respectively. Actin cytoskeleton dynamics was evaluated by laser confocal microscopy using fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin. Cell motility was analyzed by an in vitro wound-healing migration assay. We propose that ABCC6 expression may be controlled by the AKT pathway as part of an adaptative response to oxidative stress, which can be mitigated by the use of Quercetin-like flavonoids.",2021 Apr
99,"Popa DS,Bigman G,Rusu ME",The Role of Vitamin K in Humans: Implication in Aging and Age-Associated Diseases.,"As human life expectancy is rising, the incidence of age-associated diseases will also increase. Scientific evidence has revealed that healthy diets, including good fats, vitamins, minerals, or polyphenolics, could have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, with antiaging effects. Recent studies demonstrated that vitamin K is a vital cofactor in activating several proteins, which act against age-related syndromes. Thus, vitamin K can carboxylate osteocalcin (a protein capable of transporting and fixing calcium in bone), activate matrix Gla protein (an inhibitor of vascular calcification and cardiovascular events) and carboxylate Gas6 protein (involved in brain physiology and a cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease inhibitor). By improving insulin sensitivity, vitamin K lowers diabetes risk. It also exerts antiproliferative, proapoptotic, autophagic effects and has been associated with a reduced risk of cancer. Recent research shows that protein S, another vitamin K-dependent protein, can prevent the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 cases. The reduced activation of protein S due to the pneumonia-induced vitamin K depletion was correlated with higher thrombogenicity and possibly fatal outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Our review aimed to present the latest scientific evidence about vitamin K and its role in preventing age-associated diseases and/or improving the effectiveness of medical treatments in mature adults ˃50 years old.",2021 Apr

We herein report the case of a patient with chondrosarcoma of the sternum and our management of the chest wall defects that presented following radical tumor resection. CASE SUMMARY: A 31-year-old patient presented to our hospital with dull pain and a protruding mass overlying the chest for 3 mo. The presence of nocturnal pain and mass size progression was reported, as were overhead arm elevation-related limitations. Computed tomography showed a focal osteoblastic mass in the sternum with bony exostosis and adjacent soft tissue calcification. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed hypermetabolic activity with a mass located over the upper sternum. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a focal ill-defined bony mass of the sternum with cortical destruction and periosteal reaction. Preoperative biopsy showed a consistent result with chondrosarcoma with immunohistochemical positivity for S100 and focal positivity for IDH-1. The grade II chondrosarcoma diagnosis was confirmed by postoperative pathology. The patient underwent radical tumor resection and chest wall reconstruction with a locking plate and cement spacer. The patient was discharged 1 wk after surgery without any complications. At the 1-year follow-up, there was no local recurrence on imaging. The functional scores, including Constant Score, Nottingham Clavicle Score, and Oxford Shoulder Score, showed the absence of pain in the performance of daily activities or substantial functional disabilities. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of chondrosarcoma must be considered when chest wall tumors are encountered. The surgical reconstructive materials, with a locking plate and cement spacer, used in our study are cost-effective and readily-available for the sternum defect.",2021 Apr 6

Material/Methods: A total of 145 patients preoperatively diagnosed with malignant nodules under the thyroid anterior capsule were selected and routinely examined by ultrasound. The length of the nodules (from the junction of the nodule capsule to the deepest point of the nodule, vertical diameter, V) and the distance between the nodule protruding from thyroid capsule and the highest protruding (ledge length, L) nodule were used to obtain the L/V ratio. These parameters where then used to compare the efficacy of predicting extra-thyroid extension (ETE) between L/V, the aspect ratio of the tumor, and manual judgment. Results: Out of 145 nodules, there were 63 ETEs and 82 non-ETEs determined by ultrasound. Extra-capsular invasion was associated with L//V ratio, but there was no significant correlation between capsular invasion and AR (aspect ratio), age, location, or presence of clustered calcification. The ability of the ratio of L/V to predict extra-capsular invasion was superior to the predictive ability of the AR ratio. With a Youden index of 0.593, the L/V ratio was 0.2325. The use of the L/V ratio to determine the presence of ETE was superior to subjective visual judgment. Conclusions: The calculation of L/V ratio by ultrasound could more precisely predict the ETE compared with manual judgment, which indirectly reflects the interaction between thyroid capsule and malignant nodules. The above conclusions need to be confirmed by a range of cases.",2021

We evaluated the association between serum OPN levels and the first postoperative hospitalization and all-cause mortality in patients who received kidney transplantation (KT). Materials and Methods:: Seventy KT recipients were enrolled in this study from January to April 2012. The primary end point was first postoperative hospitalization or death. All patients were monitored in the outpatient clinics until June 30, 2017. Serum OPN level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results:: During follow-up (median length, 65 months), 47 first postoperative hospitalizations and 8 deaths occurred. In comparison with serum median OPN levels, serum OPN level was positively associated with KT duration (P = 0.048), serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN; P = 0.043), and serum creatinine levels (P = 0.045) but negatively associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; P = 0.049). Hospitalized KT recipients had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) (P = 0.032), BUN (P = 0.002), and serum OPN level (P = 0.001) but lower eGFR (P = 0.030) than did patients not hospitalized. KT recipients who died had higher serum level of creatinine (P = 0.009) and OPN (P = 0.001) but lower eGFR (P = 0.036) than did surviving patients. Multivariate Cox analysis adjusted for age, gender, DM, hypertension, eGFR, KT duration, and steroid used showed that serum OPN level was associated with both first postoperative hospitalization (P = 0.049) and all-cause mortality (P = 0.017). Conclusions:: Serum OPN level is a potential biomarker for first postoperative hospitalization and all-cause mortality in KT recipients.",2022 Apr-Jun

It is closely associated with mortality from cardiovascular events. Traditionally, calcification is considered as a degenerative disease associated with the aging process, while increasing evidence has shown that the occurrence and development of calcification is an active biological process, which is highly regulated by multiple factors. The molecular mechanisms of VC have not yet been fully elucidated. Exosomes, as important transporters of substance transport and intercellular communication, have been shown to participate in VC. The regulation of VC by exosomes involves a number of complex biological processes, which occur through a variety of interaction mechanisms. However, the specific role and mechanism of exosomes in the process of VC are still not fully understood and require further study. This review will briefly describe the roles of exosomes in the process of VC including in the promotion of extracellular mineral deposits, induction of phenotypic conversion of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), transport of microRNA between cells, and regulation on autophagy and oxidative stress, with the aim of providing novel ideas for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of VC.",2021 Apr 2021 Apr

The injection of nanoparticles, with high specificity to the bone, into the egg is a potential method to improve bone quality. The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential effect of calcium carbonate nanoparticles injected to the egg on chicken embryo development and bone quality of broiler chickens after 42 day of life. The calcium carbonate nanoparticles were not toxic to embryo and even improved the bone quality of embryos and later broilers without negative impact on production results. Thus, the application of calcium carbonate nanoparticles to the egg may be the potential solution for improving the bone mineralization of broiler chickens. Abstract: The use of intensive selection procedure in modern broiler chicken lines has led to the development of several skeletal disorders in broiler chickens. Therefore, current research is focused on methods to improve the bone quality in birds. In ovo technology, using nanoparticles with a high specificity to bones, is a potential approach. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of in ovo inoculation (IOI) of calcium carbonate nanoparticles (CCN) on chicken embryo development, health status, bone characteristics, and on broiler production results and bone quality. After assessing in vitro cell viability, the IOI procedure was performed with an injection of 500 μg/mL CCN. The control group was not inoculated with CCN. Hatchability, weight, and selected bone and serum parameters were measured in embryos. Part of hatchlings were reared under standard conditions until 42 days, and production results, meat quality, and bone quality of broilers were determined. CCN did not show cytotoxicity to cells and chicken embryo and positively influenced bone parameters of the embryos and of broilers later (calcification) without negatively affecting the production results. Thus, the IOI of CCN could modify the molecular responses at the stage of embryogenesis, resulting in better mineralization, and could provide a sustained effect, thereby improving bone quality in adult birds.",2021 Apr

However, the specific regulatory mechanism between the pectoral muscle and sternum in birds was largely unknown. The present study explored the potential relationship between them in ducks. The result of the sections showed that more nuclei in proliferate states were observed in the pectoral muscle fibers attached to the calcified sternum, than those attached to the un-calcified sternum. The RNA-seq identified 328 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the sternum between the calcified and un-calcified groups. Gene ontology (GO) showed that the DEGs were mainly enriched in pathways associated with calcification. In addition, DEGs in the muscles between the calcified and un-calcified sternum groups were mainly annotated to signal transduction receptor pathways. The expression patterns of genes encoding for secreted proteins, in bone (CXCL12, BMP7 and CTSK) and muscle (LGI1), were clustered with muscle development (MB) and bone calcification (KCNA1, OSTN, COL9A3, and DCN) related genes, respectively, indicating the regulatory relationships through a paracrine pathway existing between the sternum and pectoral muscles in ducks. Together, we demonstrated that the pectoral muscle development was affected by the sternal ossification states in ducks. The VEGFA, CXCL12, SPP1, NOG, and BMP7 were possibly the key genes to participate in the ossification of the duck sternum. We firstly listed evidence supporting the regulatory relationships through a paracrine pathway between the sternum and pectoral muscles in ducks, which provided scientific data for the study of the synergistic development of bone and skeletal muscle.",2021 Apr

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between radiation exposure and atherosclerosis, an underlying pathology of cardiovascular diseases, in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. We performed a cross-sectional study measuring 14 clinical-physiological atherosclerosis indicators during clinical exams from 2010 to 2014 in 3274 participants of the Adult Health Study cohort. Multivariable analyses were performed by using a structural equation model with latent factors representing underlying atherosclerotic pathologies: (1) arterial stiffness, (2) calcification, and (3) plaque　as measured with indicators chosen a priori on the basis of clinical-physiological knowledge. Radiation was linearly associated with calcification (standardized coefficient per Gy 0.15, 95 % confidence interval: CI [0.070, 0.23]) and plaque (0.11, 95 % CI [0.029, 0.20]), small associations that were comparable to about 2 years of aging per Gy of radiation exposure, but not with arterial stiffness (0.036, 95 % CI [− 0.025, 0.095]). The model fitted better and had narrower confidence intervals than separate ordinary regression models explaining individual indicators independently. The associations were less evident when the dose range was restricted to a maximum of 2 or 1 Gy. By combining individual clinical-physiological indicators that are correlated because of common, underlying atherosclerotic pathologies, we found a small, but significant association of radiation with atherosclerosis.Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10654-021-00731-x.",2021

Arterial calcification is an actively regulated process and results from the imbalance between calcification promoting and inhibiting factors. Considering the recent advancements in medical imaging, ultrasound (US), PET/MRI, and computed tomography (CT) can be used for the selection and stratification of patients with atherosclerosis. Fifty-two subjects with asymptomatic carotid artery disease on at least one side of the neck will be included in the study. At baseline, an Na[18F]F PET/MRI and CT examination will be performed. Afterwards, subjects will be randomized (1:1) to a vitamin K (400 µg MK-7/day) and vitamin D3 (80 µg/day) or to placebo. At the 3-month follow-up, subjects will undergo a second Na[18F]F PET/MRI and CT scan. The primary endpoint is the change in Na[18F]F PET/MRI (baseline vs. after 3 months) in the treatment group as compared to the placebo arm. Secondary endpoints are changes in plaque composition and in blood-biomarkers.

Unlike a typical EIC of the breast, the EIC in the present case was a cystic and solid lesion containing a large amount of liquid within the cyst and popcorn-like calcification in the wall. In this report, we describe the contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM), ultrasonography, and computed tomography findings and provide a reference for the diagnosis of EICs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the CESM findings of an EIC. Our case illustrates that CESM has excellent performance similar to that of magnetic resonance imaging and is much more effective than conventional digital mammography.

111,"Chen Z,Li R,Pei L,Wei Z,Xie J,Wu H,Xu B",High‐mobility group box‐1 promotes vascular calcification in diabetic mice via endoplasmic reticulum stress.,"Several studies reported the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in vascular calcification. High‐mobility group box‐1 (HMGB‐1) plays a substantial role in diabetes and its complications. However, relatively little information is available regarding the association between HMGB‐1 and calcification, and the underlying mechanism has still remained elusive. Therefore, in the present study, we attempted to indicate whether HMGB‐1 could promote vascular calcification via ERS in diabetes. After induction of diabetes by Streptozotocin (STZ), mice were treated with glycyrrhizin (Gly) or 4‐phenylbutyrate (4‐PBA). Mineral deposition was confirmed by reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) and calcium assay. In cell experiments, calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was performed with Alizarin Red staining, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and RT‐PCR. Expression and location of HMGB‐1 in aortic tissue were detected by Western blotting, immunocytochemistry (ICC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Diabetic mice demonstrated increased HMGB‐1 expression, ERS and vascular calcification. However, inhibition of HMGB‐1 with Gly or inhibition of ERS with 4‐PBA ameliorated the enhanced vascular calcification and ERS in diabetic mice. In vitro experiments unveiled that inhibition of HMGB‐1 attenuated advanced glycation end products (AGEs)‐induced ERS in VSMCs. In addition, AGEs promoted translocation and secretion of HMGB‐1 in VSMCs, which was reversed by 4‐PBA. Moreover, VSMCs exhibited increased mineralization and osteogenic gene expressions in response to HMGB‐1 and AGEs. However, inhibition of ERS with 4‐PBA partially, although noticeably, attenuated VSMC calcification induced by HMGB‐1. Thus, diabetes induced translocation and secretion of HMGB‐1 via ERS, which resulted in calcification in diabetic mice and in AGEs‐treated VSMCs.",2021 Apr
112,"Cong J,Cheng B,Liu J,He P",RTEF-1 Inhibits Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Calcification through Regulating Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.,"Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevailing in cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease and, when present, is associated with cardiovascular events and mortality. The osteogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is regarded as the foundation for mediating VC. Related transcriptional enhancer factor (RTEF-1), also named as transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) 4 or transcriptional enhancer factor-3 (TEF-3), is a nuclear transcriptional factor with a potent effect on cardiovascular diseases, apart from its oncogenic role in the canonical Hippo pathway. However, the role and mechanism of RTEF-1 in VC, particularly in calcification of VSMCs, are poorly understood. Our results showed that RTEF-1 was reduced in calcified VSMCs. RTEF-1 significantly ameliorated β-glycerophosphate (β-GP)-induced VSMCs calcification, as detected by alizarin red staining and calcium content assay. Also, RTEF-1 reduced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and decreased expressions of osteoblast markers such as Osteocalcin and Runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx2), but increased expression of contractile protein, including SM α-actin (α-SMA). Additionally, RTEF-1 inhibited β-GP-activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway which plays a critical role in calcification and osteogenic differentiation of VSMCs. Specifically, RTEF-1 reduced the levels of Wnt3a, p-β-catenin (Ser675), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), and p-GSK-3β (Ser9), but increased the levels of p-β-catenin (Ser33/37). Also, RTEF-1 increased the ratio of p-β-catenin (Ser33/37) to β-catenin proteins and decreased the ratio of p-GSK-3β (Ser9) to GSK-3β protein. LiCl, a Wnt/β-catenin signaling activator, was observed to reverse the protective effect of RTEF-1 overexpression on VSMCs calcification induced by β-GP. Accordingly, Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), a Wnt antagonist, attenuated the role of RTEF-1 deficiency in β-GP-induced VSMCs calcification. Taken together, we concluded that RTEF-1 ameliorated β-GP-induced calcification and osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.",2021

Mammography is currently the primary imaging modality used as a screening tool to detect early breast cancer in women experiencing no symptoms as they are most curable in the early stage with availability of breast conservative therapies. Objective:: This study aimed at determining the mammographic breast density patterns and outcome in asymptomatic women who presented for mammographic examination in Abuja. Materials and Methods:: This descriptive cross-sectional study comprises of 113 asymptomatic women who presented for mammographic examination at the Radiology Department of University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada from March 2015 to December 2018. Two basic views (craniocaudal and mediolateral views) of the breast were obtained using EXR-650 mammographic machine. Results:: The mean age of study population was 40.72 ± 10.45 years with age range of 35 and 65 years. Base on mammographic breast density, breast imaging, reporting, and data system 1 and 2 were the most prevalent. There was a positive correlation between mammographic breast density and age of respondents. This relationship was statistically significant (Pearson correlation = 0.56, P = 0.000). The mammographic outcome among asymptomatic women who had mammographic examination was negative in 69 (61.1%) women and positive in 44 (38.9%). The positive outcome noted in mammograms of women examined was: benign mass in 18 (15.9%) women; 9 (8.0%) had benign calcification; 7 (6.2%) showed architectural distortion; 5 (4.4%) was inconclusive; focal asymmetry in 3 (2.6%); and suspicious mass in 2 (1.8%). Conclusion:: In this study, screening of women reveals various benign and malignant breast pathologies which necessitate early interventions.",2021 Jan-Mar
114,"Gonzalez-Galofre ZN,Alcaide-Corral CJ,Tavares AAS",Effects of administration route on uptake kinetics of 18F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography in mice.,"18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) is a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer widely used in skeletal imaging and has also been proposed as a biomarker of active calcification in atherosclerosis. Like most PET radiotracers, 18F-NaF is typically administered intravenously. However in small animal research intravenous administrations can be challenging, because partial paravenous injection is common due to the small calibre of the superficial tail veins and repeat administrations via tail veins can lead to tissue injury therefore limiting the total number of longitudinal scanning points. In this paper, the feasibility of using intra-peritoneal route of injection of 8F-NaF to study calcification in mice was studied by looking at the kinetic and uptake profiles of normal soft tissues and bones versus intra-vascular injections. Dynamic PET was performed for 60 min on nineteen isoflurane-anesthetized male Swiss mice after femoral artery (n = 7), femoral vein (n = 6) or intraperitoneal (n = 6) injection of 8F-NaF. PET data were reconstructed and the standardised uptake value (SUV) and standardised uptake value ratio (SUVr) were estimated from the last three frames between 45- and 60-min and 8F-NaF uptake constant (Ki) was derived by Patlak graphical analysis. In soft tissue, the 18F-NaF perfusion phase changes depending on the type on injection route, whereas the uptake phase is similar regardless of the administration route. In bone tissue SUV, SUVr and Ki measures were not significantly different between the three administration routes. Comparison between PET and CT measures showed that bones that had the highest CT density displayed the lowest PET activity and conversely, bones where CT units were low had high 8F-NaF uptake. Intraperitoneal injection is a valid and practical alternative to the intra-vascular injections in small-animal 18F-NaF PET imaging providing equivalent pharmacokinetic data. CT outcome measures report on sites of stablished calcification whereas PET measures sites of higher complexity and active calcification.",2021

This study aimed to investigate the independent risk factors for ipsi-LLNM in PTC patients by combining dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) with thyroid function indicators. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 406 patients with a pathological diagnosis of PTC from Jan 2016 to Dec 2019. Ensure the DECT images were clear and the thyroid function indicators were complete. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses explored the independent risk factors for ipsi-LLNM. To evaluate the cutoff value of each risk factor by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: A total of 406 patients with PTC were analyzed, including 128 with ipsi-LLNM and 278 without ipsi-LLNM. There were statistical differences of parameters between the two groups (P < .0001), including serum Tg, Anti-Tg, Anti-TPO, the volume of the primary lesion, calcification, extrathyroidal extension (ETE), and iodine concentration (IC) in the arterial and the venous phases. Independent risk factors for ipsi-LLNM included serum Tg, Anti-Tg, ETE, and IC in the arterial and the venous phases (P < .05). The combined application of the above independent risk factors can predict the possibility of ipsi-LLNM, with an AUC of 0.834. Ipsi-LLNM was more likely to occur when the following conditions were met: with ETE, Tg >  100.01 ng/mL, Anti-Tg >  89.43 IU/mL, IC in arterial phase > 3.4 mg/mL and IC in venous phase > 3.1 mg/mL. Conclusions: The combined application of DECT quantitative parameters and thyroid function indicators can help clinicians accurately predict ipsi-LLNM before surgery, thereby assisting the individualized formulation of surgical procedures.

GCT of the breast is rare and while predominantly benign, it can be difficult to differentiate from breast cancer by imaging. While it is not generally associated with breast cancer, we here report a rare case of GCT coexisting with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). A 38-year-old Japanese woman had microcalcification suggestive of malignancy in the right upper breast and a 6-cm well-defined mass in the right lower breast. Ultrasonography showed that the lower mass was circular in shape with a clear border, and internal echo level was slightly uneven. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging found that the inside was unevenly contrast-enhanced and showed fast/washout enhanced pattern. Hence, imaging could not exclude malignancy. Pathological diagnosis from biopsies taken from the upper calcification and lower mass was DCIS and GCT, respectively. Imaging showed no evidence of continuity between the two, but the patient elected for mastectomy. Final pathological diagnosis confirmed an S-100-positive and keratin-negative GCT for the lower lesion and no histological evidence of continuity. Although GCT is a rare disease, greater awareness of the disease and its imaging findings is needed to avoid overdiagnosis, particularly when it coexists with breast cancer.",2021 Jan-Apr

Our previous studies revealed that PXE might be associated with premature aging. Treatment with statins showed positive effects not only for PXE but also for other diseases associated with premature aging like Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms in the case of PXE remain unclear. Thus, this study was performed to evaluate the efficiency of atorvastatin by analyzing key characteristics of the PXE phenotype in primary human dermal fibroblasts of PXE patients. Our data indicate that an atorvastatin treatment has a positive effect, especially on factors associated with cholesterol biosynthesis and prenylation processes, whereas the effect on age- and calcification-related factors was less pronounced.",2021 Feb

Substantial time may be required to analyse all sections. In cases of uncertainty regarding which sections to focus on, noninvasive scout imaging of intact blocks can help in guiding the pathology procedure. The scouting step is ideally done in a time window of minutes without special sample preparation that may interfere with the pathology procedures. The challenge is to obtain some visibility of unstained tissue structures at sub‐10 µm resolution.We explored a novel x‐ray tomosynthesis method as a way to maximise contrast‐to‐noise ratio, a determinant of tissue visibility. It provided a z‐stack of thousands of images at 7.3 μm resolution (10% contrast, half‐period of 68.5 line pairs/mm), in scans of 5‐15 minutes. When compared with micro‐CT scans, the straight‐line tomosynthesis scan did not need to rotate the sample, which allowed flat samples, such as paraffin blocks, to be kept as close as possible to the x‐ray source. Thus, given the same hardware, scan time and resolution, this mode maximised the photon flux density through the sample, which helped in maximising the contrast‐to‐noise ratio. The tradeoff of tomosynthesis is incomplete 3D information.The microtomosynthesis scanner has scanned 110 unstained human and animal tissue samples as part of their respective pathology protocols. In all cases, the z‐stack of images showed tissue structures that guided sectioning or provided correlative structural information. We describe six examples that presented different levels of visibility of soft tissue structures. Additionally, in a set of coronary artery samples from an HIV patient donor, microtomosynthesis made a new discovery of isolated focal calcification in the internal elastic lamina of coronary wall, which was the onset of medial calcific sclerosis in the arteries.",2021 Jul
119,"Shi W,Lu J,Li J,Qiu M,Lu Y,Gu J,Kong X,Sun W",Piperlongumine Attenuates High Calcium/Phosphate-Induced Arterial Calcification by Preserving P53/PTEN Signaling.,"Vascular calcification frequently occurs in the process of chronic kidney disease, atherosclerosis and aging, resulting in an increased prevalence of cardiovascular events. Piperlongumine (PLG) is a natural product isolated from Piper longum L. Here, we aimed to explore the effect of PLG in high calcium- and phosphate-induced vascular calcification and the associated mechanism. Flow cytometry assays showed that PLG at concentrations <10 μM did not promote vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) apoptosis, and PLG at concentrations >2.5 μM inhibited VSMCs proliferation. Thus, 2.5 μM PLG was selected for subsequent experiments. Alizarin red staining and ALP activity assays showed that PLG inhibited calcium deposition of VSMCs treated with high calcium/phosphate medium. PLG also decreased the expression of osteogenic genes and proteins, including Runx2, Bmp2, and OPN, as determined by qRT-PCR and western blotting. In a vitamin D-induced aortic calcification mouse model, a 5 mg/kg dose of PLG decreased calcium deposition in the aortic wall as well as Runx2 expression. With regard to the mechanism, we found that the levels of P53 mRNA and protein in both VSMCs and mouse aortic tissues were decreased in the calcification models, and we observed that PLG preserved the levels of P53 and its downstream gene PTEN. Concurrent treatment of VSMCs with P53 ShRNA and PLG blunted the anti-calcific effect of PLG. In conclusion, PLG attenuates high calcium/phosphate-induced vascular calcification by upregulating P53/PTEN signaling in VSMCs. PLG may act as a promising herbal extract for the clinical management of vascular calcification.",2020

In this study, we investigated a link between End–MT and the osteogenic process and explored the involvement of miR-30a-5p and miR-30d as potential regulators of these processes. End–MT was induced in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) through transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), TGFβ-3 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), for 24 h and 6 days. End–MT mediators, mesenchymal and osteo/chondrogenic markers were analyzed through Real-Time PCR, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and Western Blot. miR-30a-5p and miR-30d over-expression was carried out in HUVEC to explore their effects on End–MT and osteogenic differentiation. HUVEC at 24 h and 6 days gained mesenchymal morphology markers, including matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), SLUG, VIMENTIN and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and a significant migratory potential, notably with TNF-α. After 6 days, the osteo/chondrogenic markers runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX-2) and SRY box transcription factor 9 (SOX-9) were upregulated. At this time point, miR-30a-5p and miR-30d decreased. Over-expression of miR-30a-5p and miR-30d affected End–MT mediators and the osteogenic potency in HUVEC, by reducing SLUG, VIMENTIN and RUNX-2. Our data suggest that End–MT represents a key link between inflammation and vascular calcification. Further, miR-30a-5p and miR-30d can regulate both the End–MT and the osteogenic processes, prompting future studies for exploring their potential use as therapeutic targets or biomarkers in vascular diseases.",2021 Feb

There is no effective treatment for the systemic manifestations of PXE. In this study, the efficacy of INS-3001, an analog of phytic acid, was tested for inhibition of ectopic calcification in an Abcc6−/− mouse model of PXE. In prevention study, Abcc6−/− mice, at 6 weeks of age, the time of onset of ectopic calcification, were treated with INS-3001 with 0.16, 0.8, 4, 20 or 100 mg/kg/day administered by subcutaneous implantation of osmotic pumps, as well as 4 mg/kg/day by subcutaneous injection thrice weekly or 14, 4, and 0.8 mg/kg/day once weekly subcutaneous injection. Mice were necropsied at 12 weeks of age. Histologic examination and quantitative calcium assay revealed that mice receiving 6 weeks of continuous INS-3001 administration via osmotic pumps showed dose-dependent inhibition of muzzle skin calcification with complete response at 4 mg/kg/day and a minimum effective dose at 0.8 mg/kg/day. INS-3001 plasma concentrations were dose-dependent and largely consistent during treatment for each dose. Thrice weekly and once weekly subcutaneous injections of INS-3001 also prevented calcification. In established disease study, 12-week-old Abcc6−/− mice with extensive calcification were continuously administered INS-3001 at 4 mg/kg/day for a follow-up of 12 weeks. INS-3001 treatment was found to stabilize existing calcification that had developed at start of treatment. These results suggest that INS-3001 may provide a promising preventive treatment strategy for PXE, a currently intractable ectopic calcification disorder.",2021 Jun

However, it is unclear whether attaining normoglycemia can ameliorate the excess CVD risk associated with GD history. This study sought to evaluate GD history and glucose tolerance after pregnancy associated with coronary artery calcification (CAC) in women, a manifestation of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD), and predictor of CVD clinical events. Methods:: Data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, a U.S. multicenter, community-based prospective cohort of young Black (50%) and White adults aged 18–30 years at baseline (1985–1986). The sample included 1,133 women without diabetes at baseline, who had one or more singleton births (n=2,066) during follow up, glucose tolerance testing at baseline and up to 5 times during 25 years (1986–2011), GD status, and CAC measurements at follow up exam at years 15, 20, and/or 25 (2001–2011). CAC was measured by non-contrast cardiac computed tomography; dichotomized as Any CAC (score>0) or No CAC (score=0). Complementary log-log models for interval-censored data estimated adjusted hazard ratios of CAC and 95% confidence intervals for GD history and subsequent glucose tolerance groups (normoglycemia, prediabetes, or incident diabetes) on average 14.7 years after the last birth adjusted for pre-pregnancy and follow up covariates. Results:: Of 1,133 women, 139 (12.3%) reported GD and were aged 47.6 years (4.8 SD) at follow up. CAC was present in 25% (34/139) of women with GD and 15% (149/994) of women with no GD. Compared to no GD/normoglycemia, adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.54 (1.06, 2.24) for no GD/prediabetes and 2.17 (1.30, 3.62) for no GD/incident diabetes, and 2.34 (1.34, 4.09), 2.13 (1.09, 4.17) and 2.02 (0.98, 4.19) for GD/normoglycemia, GD/prediabetes, and GD/incident diabetes, respectively (overall p-value=0.003). Conclusions:: Women without previous GD showed a graded increase in the risk of CAC associated with worsening glucose tolerance. Women with a history of GD had a 2-fold higher risk of CAC across all subsequent levels of glucose tolerance. Mid-life ASCVD risk among women with previous GD is not diminished by attaining normoglycemia.",2021 Mar 09

Fet A may also play a role in tumor growth and metastasis. The biological activity of Fet A may be affected by various modifications, including phosphorylation, O- and N-glycosylation and fatty acid binding. We developed an antibody-based assay for the detection of Fet A phosphorylated at serine 312. Fatty acid pattern was determined by gas chromatography. Using the antibody, we found that the phosphorylation was stable in human plasma or serum at room temperature for 8 h. We observed that Fet A is present in several glycosylation forms in human plasma, but the extent of Ser312 phosphorylation was not associated with glycosylation. The phosphorylation pattern did not change during an oral glucose tolerance test (0–120 min). We further found that human Fet A binds preferentially saturated fatty acids (>90%) at the expense of mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids. Our results indicate that different molecular species of Fet A are present in human plasma and that these different modifications may determine the different biological effects of Fet A.",2021 Feb

Methods: One view from 45 DM cases (including 30 cancers) was degraded to six levels each of two acquisition-related issues (lower spatial resolution and increased quantum noise) and three post-processing-related issues (lower and higher contrast and increased correlated noise) seen during clinical evaluation of DM systems. The images were shown to fifteen breast screening radiologists from five countries. Aware of lesion location, the radiologists selected the most-degraded mammogram (indexed from 1 (reference) to 7 (most degraded)) they still felt was acceptable for interpretation. The median selected index, per degradation type, was calculated separately for calcification and soft tissue (including normal) cases. Using the two-sided, non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, the median indices for each case and degradation type were compared. Results: Radiologists were not tolerant to increases (medians: 1.5 (calcifications) and 2 (soft tissue)) or decreases (median: 2, for both types) in contrast, but were more tolerant to correlated noise (median: 3, for both types). Increases in quantum noise were tolerated more for calcifications than for soft tissue cases (medians: 3 vs. 4, p = 0.02). Spatial resolution losses were considered less acceptable for calcification detection than for soft tissue cases (medians: 3.5 vs. 5, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Perceived ability of radiologists for image interpretation in DM was affected not only by image acquisition-related issues but also by image post-processing issues, and some of those issues affected calcification cases more than soft tissue cases. Key Points: • Lower spatial resolution and increased quantum noise affected the radiologists’ perceived ability to interpret calcification cases more than soft tissue lesion or normal cases.• Post-acquisition image processing-related effects, not only image acquisition-related effects, also impact the perceived ability of radiologists to interpret images and detect lesions.• In addition to current practices, post-acquisition image processing-related effects need to also be considered during the testing and evaluation of digital mammography systems.

Methods: We studied a Swedish kindred with ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, tremor, dysautonomia, and mild cognitive decline. Members were examined clinically, radiologically, and by histopathology. Genetic workup included whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and intrafamilial cosegregation analyses. Results: Fifteen family members were examined clinically. Twelve affected individuals had white matter hyperintensities and 1 or more of (1) stroke episodes, (2) clinically silent lacunar ischemic lesions, and (3) cognitive dysfunction. All affected individuals had tremor and/or atactic gait disturbance. Mild symmetric basal ganglia calcifications were seen in 3 affected members. Postmortem examination of 1 affected member showed pathologic alterations in both small and large arteries the brain. Skin biopsies of 3 affected members showed extracellular amorphous deposits within the subepidermal zone, which may represent degenerated arterioles. WES or WGS did not reveal any potentially disease-causing variants in known genes for cSVDs or idiopathic basal ganglia calcification, but identified 1 heterozygous variant, NM_004672.4 MAP3K6 c.322G>A p.(Asp108Asn), that cosegregated with the disease in this large family. MAP3K6 has known functions in angiogenesis and affects vascular endothelial growth factor expression, which may be implicated in cerebrovascular disease. Conclusions: Our data strongly suggest the MAP3K6 variant to be causative for this novel disease phenotype, but the absence of functional data and the present lack of additional families with this disease and MAP3K6 mutations still limit the formal evidence for the variant's pathogenicity.",2021 Feb

Although CAVD has been firstly recognized as a passive event mostly resulting from a degenerative aging process, much evidences suggests that calcification arises from different active processes, involving both aortic valve-resident cells (valve endothelial cells, valve interstitial cells, mesenchymal stem cells, innate immunity cells) and circulating cells (circulating mesenchymal cells, immunity cells).

Calcinosis cutis is the deposition of calcium within the dermis. An 80-year-old man presented with a pearly nodule on his left nasal ala; a shave biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a nodular basal cell carcinoma with calcinosis cutis, which was removed with Mohs micrographic surgery. The incidence of basal cell carcinoma with calcinosis cutis as well as the classification, identification, and potential origin of calcium deposits in basal cell carcinoma are discussed. Basal cell carcinoma can be associated with calcinosis cutis; indeed, calcifying basal cell carcinoma has a calculated incidence of 14%. There are five categories of calcification in basal cell carcinoma. In addition, calcification observed in cancer-free initial sections of a suspected basal cell carcinoma may be a diagnostic clue that a neoplasm is present in deeper sections of the tissue specimen. Although nodular basal cell carcinoma has the greatest incidence (37%) of calcium deposition, infiltrative (29%) and micronodular (27%) basal cell carcinomas are also frequently associated with calcification; therefore, the presence of calcifying basal cell carcinoma may indicate a more aggressive tumor subtype. Basal cell carcinoma may also be suspected in the differential diagnosis of a superficial breast neoplasm in which calcification is observed in the dermis; in this situation, mammography has been an effective diagnostic approach for identifying the basal cell carcinoma with calcification. The pathogenesis of calcification in basal cell carcinoma remains to be definitively established; however, calcium-binding proteins found in poorly differentiated keratinocytes may contribute to the etiology of basal cell carcinoma with calcification. The treatment of basal cell carcinomas with calcinosis cutis is similar to that of non-calcifying basal cell carcinomas; it is based upon the histologic subtype, the size, and the location of the tumor.",0

We hereby report a case of HS due to ETS with a brief literature review on this topic. Case presentation: A 31-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with an unexpected physical examination finding of two thyroid nodules that were hypoechoic, had an irregular shape, and exhibited calcification. Subsequently, the results of a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy from the thyroid nodules and BRAFV600E mutation further confirmed the malignancy of these nodules. Thus, total thyroidectomy combined with central lymph node dissection (CLND) by ETS via the bilateral axillo-breast approach was performed on this patient. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) concurrent with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT). However, this patient developed HS with ptosis in her left eye on postoperative day 3. All symptoms gradually resolved before the 3-month follow-up. Conclusion: HS subsequent to ETS is a rare complication. Thus, standardized and appropriate operative procedures, as well as subtle manipulation, are essential in preventing and reducing the occurrence of HS. In addition, the early diagnosis and management of this rare complication are also important for a favorable outcome.",2021

Moreover, hyperprolactinemia and overall hypopituitarism caused by metastatic spread leading to the initial symptoms are rare. CASE SUMMARY: A 53-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with complaints of bilateral blurred vision, dizziness, polyuria, nocturia, severe fatigue and somnolence, decreased libido, and intermittent nausea and vomiting for more than 6 mo. During the last 7 d, the dizziness had worsened. Laboratory investigations revealed overall hypofunction of the pituitary gland, but the patient had an elevated serum prolactin level (703.35 mg/mL). Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumor in the sellar region, accompanied by intratumoral hemorrhage and calcification. Thus, transnasal subtotal resection of the lesion in the sellar region was performed. The histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the resected lesion revealed metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma to the pituitary gland. Oral hydrocortisone (30 mg/d) and levothyroxine (25 mg/d) were given both pre- and postoperatively. Post-operatively, the clinical symptoms were significantly improved. However, 4 mo following the surgery, the patient succumbed due to multiple organ failure.

All 4a lesions were randomly divided into development and validation groups at the ratio of 3:1. In the development group consisting of 499 cases, the multiple clinical and ultrasound predicted factors were extracted, and dual-predicted nomograms were constructed by multivariable logistic regression analysis, named clinical nomogram and ultrasound nomogram, respectively. Patients were twice classified as either “high risk” or “low risk” in the two nomograms. The performance of these dual nomograms was assessed by an independent validation group of 181 cases. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and diagnostic value were calculated to evaluate the applicability of the new model.Results: After multiple logistic regression analysis, the clinical nomogram included 2 predictors: age and the first-degree family members with breast cancer. The area under the curve (AUC) value for the clinical nomogram was 0.661 and 0.712 for the development and validation groups, respectively. The ultrasound nomogram included 3 independent predictors (margins, calcification and strain ratio), and the AUC value in this nomogram was 0.782 and 0.747 in the development and validation groups, respectively.

Thus far, scholars have identified a total of 17 VKDPs in the human body. In this review, we summarize three important emerging VKDPs: Growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas 6), Gla-rich protein (GRP) and periostin in terms of their functions in physiological and pathological conditions. As examples, carboxylated Gas 6 and GRP effectively protect blood vessels from calcification, Gas 6 protects from acute kidney injury and is involved in chronic kidney disease, GRP contributes to bone homeostasis and delays the progression of osteoarthritis, and periostin is involved in all phases of fracture healing and assists myocardial regeneration in the early stages of myocardial infarction. However, periostin participates in the progression of cardiac fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and airway remodeling of asthma. In addition, we discuss the relationship between vitamin K, VKDPs and cancer, and particularly the carboxylation state of VKDPs in cancer.",2021 Mar
135,"Yaker L,Kamel S,Ausseil J,Boullier A",Effects of Chronic Kidney Disease and Uremic Toxins on Extracellular Vesicle Biology.,"Vascular calcification (VC) is a cardiovascular complication associated with a high mortality rate, especially in patients with diabetes, atherosclerosis or chronic kidney disease (CKD). In CKD patients, VC is associated with the accumulation of uremic toxins, such as indoxyl sulphate or inorganic phosphate, which can have a major impact in vascular remodeling. During VC, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) undergo an osteogenic switch and secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are heterogeneous in terms of their origin and composition. Under physiological conditions, EVs are involved in cell-cell communication and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. They contain high levels of calcification inhibitors, such as fetuin-A and matrix Gla protein. Under pathological conditions (and particularly in the presence of uremic toxins), the secreted EVs acquire a pro-calcifying profile and thereby act as nucleating foci for the crystallization of hydroxyapatite and the propagation of calcification. Here, we review the most recent findings on the EVs’ pathophysiological role in VC, the impact of uremic toxins on EV biogenesis and functions, the use of EVs as diagnostic biomarkers and the EVs’ therapeutic potential in CKD.",2020 Dec

Methods: We analyzed the records of 40 patients diagnosed with DCISM and 61 patients with DCIS who were hospitalized at Shengjing Hospital (Shenyang, China) from January 2009 to June 2016. The size, hardness, and degree of calcification of tumors were determined by mammography and ultrasonography. Results: In all, 37 DCISM patients and 45 DCIS patients showed clinical palpable masses (92.5% vs 73.77%, P = 0.018). Mammography showed that the mean size of tumor was larger in DCISM patients than that of DCIS patients (3.13 ± 1.51 vs 2.68 ± 1.77, P = 0.030). Ultrasound examination revealed calcification shadows in the solid tumor mass in 17 DCISM cases and 11 DCIS patients (42.5 vs 18.03%, P = 0.007). Furthermore, estrogen receptor positivity and progesterone receptor positivity were more common in DCIS patients (32.5% vs 54.10%, P = 0.033; 22.5% vs 45.90%, P = 0.017), and the percentage of menopausal patients were higher in DCISM patients than that of DCIS patients (70.00% vs 47.54%, P = 0.026). Conclusion: Clinically palpable and calcified tumor masses on sonography are more commonly encountered in DCISM lesions.",2021 Jan

138,"Vidavsky N,Kunitake JA,Estroff LA",Multiple Pathways for Pathological Calcification in the Human Body.,"Biomineralization of skeletal components (e.g., bone and teeth) is generally accepted to occur under strict cellular regulation, leading to mineral-organic composites with hierarchical structures and properties optimized for their designated function. Such cellular regulation includes promoting mineralization at desired sites as well as inhibiting mineralization in soft tissues and other undesirable locations. In contrast, pathological mineralization, with potentially harmful health effects, can occur as a result of tissue or metabolic abnormalities, disease, or implantation of certain biomaterials. This Progress Report defines mineralization pathway components and identifies the commonalities (and differences) between physiological (e.g, bone remodeling) and pathological calcification formation pathways, based, in part, upon the extent of cellular control within the system. These concepts are discussed in representative examples of calcium phosphate-based pathological mineralization in cancer (breast, thyroid, ovarian, and meningioma) and in cardiovascular disease. In-depth mechanistic understanding of pathological mineralization requires utilizing state-of-the-art materials science imaging and characterization techniques, focusing not only on the final deposits, but also on the earlier stages of crystal nucleation, growth, and aggregation. Such mechanistic understanding will further enable the use of pathological calcifications in diagnosis and prognosis, as well as possibly provide insights into preventative treatments for detrimental mineralization in disease.",2021 Feb

Endobronchial ultrasound multimodal imaging has great value for the diagnosis of intrathoracic lymph nodes. This study aimed to analyze the application of endobronchial ultrasound multimodal imaging on lung lesions. Methods: Patients undergoing endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in Shanghai Chest Hospital from July 2018 to December 2019 were retrospectively enrolled. Nine grayscale features (long and short axes, margin, shape, lobulation sign, echogenicity, necrosis, liquefaction, calcification, and air-bronchogram), blood flow volume and elastography five-score method were analyzed to explore the best diagnostic method. The gold standard for diagnosing lesions depends on the histological and cytopathological findings of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration, transthoracic biopsy, resected sample of lesions, microbiological examination or clinical follow-up of at least 6 months. Results: Endobronchial ultrasound multimodal imaging of 97 malignant lung lesions and 19 benign lung lesions from 116 patients were analyzed. There were statistically significant differences in distinct margin, presence of lobulation sign, presence of necrosis, and elastography grading score 4–5 between malignant and benign lung lesions, among which presence of lobulation sign and elastography grading score 4–5 were independent predictors. A diagnostic scoring model was then constructed based on the above four features, and when two or more features were present, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy for malignant lung lesions prediction were 92.78%, 57.89%, 91.84%, 61.11% and 87.07%, respectively. Conclusions: The combination of endobronchial ultrasound grayscale and elastography has potential value for malignant and benign lung lesions differentiation.

Recently, periodontal phototherapy, treatment using various types of lasers, has attracted attention. Photobiomodulation, the biological effect of low-power laser irradiation, has been widely studied. Although many types of lasers are applied in periodontal phototherapy, molecular biological effects of laser irradiation on cells in periodontal tissues are unclear. Here, we have summarized the molecular biological effects of diode, Nd:YAG, Er:YAG, Er,Cr:YSGG, and CO2 lasers irradiation on cells in periodontal tissues. Photobiomodulation by laser irradiation enhanced cell proliferation and calcification in osteoblasts with altering gene expression. Positive effects were observed in fibroblasts on the proliferation, migration, and secretion of chemokines/cytokines. Laser irradiation suppressed gene expression related to inflammation in osteoblasts, fibroblasts, human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs), and endothelial cells. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed that laser irradiation affects cell differentiation in hPDLCs and stem cells. Additionally, some studies have also investigated the effects of laser irradiation on endothelial cells, cementoblasts, epithelial cells, osteoclasts, and osteocytes. The appropriate irradiation power was different for each laser apparatus and targeted cells. Thus, through this review, we tried to shed light on basic research that would ultimately lead to clinical application of periodontal phototherapy in the future.",2020 Dec

Retrospective cross-sectional study of 390 patients with BI-RADS 3, 4 and 5 mammography with available histopathology examination results were recruited from in a single center of a multi-ethnic Asian population. 2 readers independently reported the FFDM and DBT images and classified lesions detected (mass, calcifications, asymmetric density and architectural distortion) based on American College of Radiology-BI-RADS lexicon. Of the 390 patients recruited, 182 malignancies were reported. Positive predictive value (PPV) of cancer was 46.7%. The PPV in BI-RADS 4a, 4b, 4c and 5 were 6.0%, 38.3%, 68.9%, and 93.1%, respectively. Among all the cancers, 76% presented as masses, 4% as calcifications and 20% as asymmetry. An additional of 4% of cancers were detected on ultrasound. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of mass lesions detected on DBT + FFDM were 93.8%, 85.1%, 88.8% and 91.5%, respectively. The PPV for calcification is 61.6% and asymmetry is 60.7%. 81.6% of cancer detected were invasive and 13.3% were in-situ type.

ICHs are usually misdiagnosed and treated as pituitary adenomas. Therefore, a preoperative diagnosis is particularly important, especially when the goal is complete resection. Patient concerns:: A 55-year-old woman presented with a 1-month history of intermittent dizziness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a well-demarcated abnormal ellipsoid signal in the sellar region (size: 2.7 cm × 1.7 cm), with a mulberry-like enhancement after gadolinium injection. Computed tomography revealed an intrasellar mass without calcification that extended into the left cavernous sinus and was faintly contrast-enhanced. Angiography revealed a tumor with mildly delayed staining fed by the C5 segment of the right internal carotid artery. Diagnosis:: An intrasellar cavernous hemangioma based on neuroradiological examinations. Interventions:: The patient underwent surgery with an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach to debulk the lesion and obtain tissue for the pathological diagnosis. Outcomes:: Blood spurting was observed after puncture, and the capsule was stained blue. Lesion removal was stopped, and the patient underwent gamma knife surgery 1 week later. She remained in good condition during the follow-up. Lessons:: Sponge-like or mulberry-like lesions can be identified on MRI after gadolinium injection and can facilitate a preoperative diagnosis of ICH. Currently, surgical debulking with cranial nerve decompression during the acute stage and subsequent gamma knife radiosurgery are considered to be a safe and effective treatment.",2020 Nov 20

In this study, we aim to examine whether miR155 regulates vascular calcification and to understand the underlying mechanism. Quantitative real‐time PCR showed that miR155 is highly expressed in human calcific carotid tissue and positively correlated with the expression of osteogenic genes. Wound‐healing assay and TUNEL staining showed deletion of miR155 inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and apoptosis. miR155 deficiency attenuated calcification of cultured mouse VSMCs and aortic rings induced by calcification medium, whereas miR155 overexpression promoted VSMC calcification. Compared with wild‐type mice, miR155−/− mice showed significant resistance to vitamin D3 induced vascular calcification. Protein analysis showed that miR155 deficiency alleviated the reduction of Rictor, increased phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and accelerated phosphorylation and degradation of FOXO3a in cultured VSMCs and in the aortas of vitamin D3‐treated mice. A PI3K inhibitor that suppresses Akt phosphorylation increased, whereas a pan‐caspase inhibitor that suppresses apoptosis reduced VSMC calcification; and both inhibitors diminished the protective effects of miR155 deficiency on VSMC calcification. In conclusion, miR155 deficiency attenuates vascular calcification by increasing Akt phosphorylation and FOXO3a degradation, and thus reducing VSMC apoptosis induced by calcification medium.",2021 Jan

Furthermore, much evidence that osteoimmunological disorders, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or periodontitis influence the risk of developing breast cancer in women exists and vice versa. Antiresorptive drugs benefits on breast cancer incidence and progression have been reported in the past decades. More recently, biological agents targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines used against rheumatoid arthritis also demonstrated benefits against breast cancer cell lines proliferation, viability, and migratory abilities, both in vitro and in vivo in xenografted mice. Hence, it is tempting to hypothesize that breast carcinogenesis should be considered as a potential osteoimmunological disorder. In this review, we compare microenvironments and molecular characteristics in the most frequent osteoimmunological disorders with major events occurring in a woman’s breast during her lifetime. We also highlight what the use of bone anabolic drugs, antiresorptive, and biological agents targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines against breast cancer can teach us.",2020 Nov

Methods: The study reviewed the ultrasound findings and immunohistochemical features of nonhematological metastatic breast tumor cases found in patients of West China Hospital, Sichuan University from 2007 to 2019. Each case was categorized as secondary breast malignancy using histopathological results. Results: Fourteen cases were identified from West China Hospital database. Ten cases originated in the lung, 2 cases in the stomach, 1 case in the ovary and 1 case of neuroendocrine carcinomas. Fourteen masses were evaluated. Ultrasound findings showed that tumors were hypoechoic (14/14), irregular (13/14), indistinct margin (13/14), along a long axis parallel to the skin (11/14), lacked vascularity via color doppler flow imaging (9/14). Eight cases showed no posterior features. Calcification was found in 1 case of lung adenocarcinoma that had metastasized to the breast. Abnormal axillary lymph nodes were detected in 5 cases. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) were both negative in 11 cases, including gastric and lung cancer metastasis. One case of ovarian metastasis was positive for ER and negative for PR. Six patients were positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and negative for cytokeratin 20 (CK20), including lung and ovarian carcinoma metastasis. Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) was positive in 9 of 10 pulmonary carcinoma metastases. The patient of ovarian metastasis was positive for Wilms’ tumour 1 (WT-1) and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125). Two cases from gastric metastasis were positive for caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2). Conclusion: Although breast ultrasound is not useful in distinguishing metastases from primary breast cancer, it is helpful in diagnosing breast lesions as oncological diseases and provide evidence for further examination of patients. Immunohistochemistry plays an important role in distinguishing secondary breast cancer from primary, especially in patients without tumor history.",2020

Furthermore, we recommend that reports include recommendations for subsequent management, namely the assessment of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and, if the patient has chest pain, assessment as per standard guidelines. In most cases, this will not necessitate additional investigations. Incidental aortic valve calcification may also be identified on non-gated thoracic CT and should be reported, along with ancillary findings such as aortic root dilation.

Increased vascular calcification promotes arterial stiffness and accelerates cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Upregulation of the Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), an essential osteogenic transcription factor for bone formation, in the cardiovascular system has emerged as an important regulator for adverse cellular events that drive cardiovascular pathology. This review discusses the regulatory mechanisms that are critical for Runx2 expression and function, and highlights the dynamic and complex cross-talks of a wide variety of posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and O-GlcNAcylation, in regulating Runx2 stability, cellular localization and osteogenic transcriptional activity. How the activation of an array of signaling cascades by circulating and local microenvironmental factors upregulates Runx2 in vascular cells and promotes Runx2-mediated osteogenic trans-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and expression of inflammatory cytokines that accelerate macrophage infiltration and vascular osteoclast formation is summarized. Furthermore, the increasing appreciation of a new role of Runx2 upregulation in promoting VSMC phenotypic switch, and protein modulation by O-GlcNAcylation and Runx2-dependent repression of SMC-specific gene expression are discussed. Further exploring the regulation of this key osteogenic transcription factor and its new perspectives in the vasculature will provide novel insights into the transcriptional regulation of VSMC phenotype switch, reprograming and vascular inflammation that promote the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis.",2021 Jan

Because the chest x-ray is the most common imaging procedure, because the presence of coronary calcium provides proof of coronary artery disease, and because adherence to therapy can improve health, successful detection could positively impact healthcare for a large number of patients. Methods.Both dual energy chest and corroborative CT calcium score images were acquired. Dual energy images were processed with the advanced techniques, including sliding organ registration, so as to enhance coronary calcifications in two-shot dual energy acquisitions. We performed ROC to determine physicians’ ability to detect coronary calcifications. Since detection might be easier with heavier calcifications, we used various Agatston score cut-points for determining cases actually positive with calcification in the ROC analysis. Results.In many cases, coronary calcifications were made more visible with the advanced processing as compared to conventional processing. At an Agatston cut-point of 300, coronary calcifications were detected with AUC = 0.85. There were marginal effects on detection performance found with increased x-ray exposure, nearby Agatston cut-point values, and coronary artery territory. Conclusions.Coronary calcifications can be detected in dual energy chest x-rays. The ability to detect disease compares very favorably to other accepted screening methods (e.g., x-ray mammography). As the chest x-ray is an already ordered procedure, there is an opportunity to detect a very large number of persons with coronary artery disease at zero or low cost.",2021 Mar

Since breast is sensitive to x-ray radiation, dose reduction of breast CT is an important topic, and for this purpose, few-view scanning is a main approach. In this article, we propose a Deep Efficient End-to-end Reconstruction (DEER) network for few-view breast CT image reconstruction. The major merits of our network include high dose efficiency, excellent image quality, and low model complexity. By the design, the proposed network can learn the reconstruction process with as few as O(N) parameters, where N is the side length of an image to be reconstructed, which represents orders of magnitude improvements relative to the state-of-the-art deep-learning-based reconstruction methods that map raw data to tomographic images directly. Also, validated on a cone-beam breast CT dataset prepared by Koning Corporation on a commercial scanner, our method demonstrates a competitive performance over the state-of-the-art reconstruction networks in terms of image quality.

From a pathophysiological perspective, atherosclerosis is characterized by microscopic inflammation and microcalcification that precede the characteristic plaque buildup in arterial walls detected by traditional assessment methods, including anatomic imaging modalities. These processes of inflammation and microcalcification are, therefore, prime targets for molecular detection of atherosclerotic disease burden. Imaging with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 18F-sodium fluoride (NaF) can non-invasively assess arterial inflammation and microcalcification, respectively. FDG uptake reflects glucose metabolism, which is particularly increased in atherosclerotic plaques retaining macrophages and undergoing hypoxic stress. By contrast, NaF uptake reflects the exchange of hydroxyl groups of hydroxyapatite crystals for fluoride producing fluorapatite, a key biochemical step in calcification of atherosclerotic plaque. Here we review the existing literature on FDG and NaF imaging and their respective values in investigating the progression of atherosclerotic disease. Based on the large volume of data that have been introduced to the literature and discussed in this review, it is clear that PET imaging will have a major role to play in assessing atherosclerosis in the major and coronary arteries. However, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions on the potential role of FDG in investigating atherosclerosis given the vast number of studies with different designs, image acquisition methods, analyses, and interpretations. Our experience in this domain of research has suggested that NaF may be the tool of choice over FDG in assessing atherosclerosis, especially in the setting of coronary artery disease (CAD). Specifically, global NaF assessment appears to be superior in detecting plaques in tissues with high background FDG activity, such as the coronary arteries.",2020
153,"Lang F,Rajaxavier J,Singh Y,Brucker SY,Salker MS",The Enigmatic Role of Serum & Glucocorticoid Inducible Kinase 1 in the Endometrium.,"The serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) is subject to genetic up-regulation by diverse stimulators including glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, dehydration, ischemia, radiation and hyperosmotic shock. To become active, the expressed kinase requires phosphorylation, which is accomplished by PI3K/PDK1 and mTOR dependent signaling. SGK1 enhances the expression/activity of various transport proteins including Na+/K+-ATPase as well as ion-, glucose-, and amino acid- carriers in the plasma membrane. SGK1 can further up-regulate diverse ion channels, such as Na+-, Ca2+-, K+- and Cl– channels. SGK1 regulates expression/activity of a wide variety of transcription factors (such as FKHRL1/Foxo3a, β-catenin, NFκB and p53). SGK1 thus contributes to the regulation of transport, glycolysis, angiogenesis, cell survival, immune regulation, cell migration, tissue fibrosis and tissue calcification. In this review we summarized the current findings that SGK1 plays a crucial function in the regulation of endometrial function. Specifically, it plays a dual role in the regulation of endometrial receptivity necessary for implantation and, subsequently in pregnancy maintenance. Furthermore, fetal programming of blood pressure regulation requires maternal SGK1. Underlying mechanisms are, however, still ill-defined and there is a substantial need for additional information to fully understand the role of SGK1 in the orchestration of embryo implantation, embryo survival and fetal programming.",2020

Thyroid calcifications are classified according to their diameter and location. At ultrasonography, microcalcifications appear as hyperechoic spots ≤ 1 mm in diameter and can be named as stromal calcification, bone formation, or psammoma bodies (PBs), whereas calcifications > 1 mm are macrocalcifications. The mechanism of their formation is still poorly understood. Microcalcifications are generally accepted as a reliable indicator of malignancy as they mostly represent PBs. In order to progress in terms of the understanding of the mechanisms behind calcification occurring in thyroid tumors in general, and in PTC in particular, we decided to use histopathology as the basis of the possible cellular and molecular mechanisms of calcification formation in thyroid cancer. We explored the involvement of molecules such as runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx-2), osteonectin/secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and osteopontin (OPN) in the formation of calcification.

Among all the factors leading to IVDD, lumbar cartilage endplate (LCE) degeneration is considered a key factor. In the present study, we investigate the effect and regulation of carbonic anhydrase 12 (CA12) in LCE, which catalyzes hydration of CO2 and participates in a variety of biological processes, including acid–base balance and calcification. Our results show that CA12, downregulated in degenerated LCE, could maintain anabolism and prevent calcification in the endplate. Furthermore, CA12 is regulated by the IGF-1/IGF-1R/PI3K/CREB signaling pathway. When we overexpressed CA12 in LCE, the decreased anabolism induced by inflammatory cytokine could be rescued. In contrast, reducing CA12 expression, either with siRNA, PI3Kinhibitor, or CREB inhibitor, could downregulate anabolism and cause apoptosis and then calcification in LCE. The protective effects of IGF-1 are even diminished with low-expressed CA12. Similar results are also obtained in an ex vivo model. Consequently, our results reveal a novel pathway, IGF-1/IGF-1R/PI3K/CREB/CA12, that takes a protective role in LCE degeneration by maintaining anabolism and preventing calcification and apoptosis. This study proposes a novel molecular target, CA12, to delay LCE degeneration.",2020
156,"Qin Y,Li L,Luo E,Hou J,Yan G,Wang D,Qiao Y,Tang C",Role of m6A RNA methylation in cardiovascular disease (Review).,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent and abundant type of internal post-transcriptional RNA modification in eukaryotic cells. Multiple types of RNA, including mRNAs, rRNAs, tRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs, are involved in m6A methylation. The biological function of m6A modification is dynamically and reversibly mediated by methyltransferases (writers), demethylases (erasers) and m6A binding proteins (readers). The methyltransferase complex is responsible for the catalyzation of m6A modification and is typically made up of methyltransferase-like (METTL)3, METTL14 and Wilms tumor 1-associated protein. Erasers remove methylation by fat mass and obesity-associated protein and ALKB homolog 5. Readers play a role through the recognition of m6A-modified targeted RNA. The YT521-B homology domain family, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein and insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein serve as m6A readers. The m6A methylation on transcripts plays a pivotal role in the regulation of downstream molecular events and biological functions, such as RNA splicing, transport, stability and translatability at the post-transcriptional level. The dysregulation of m6A modification is associated with cancer, drug resistance, virus replication and the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. Recently, a number of studies have identified aberrant m6A methylation in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, arterial aneurysm, vascular calcification and pulmonary hypertension. The aim of the present review article was to summarize the recent research progress on the role of m6A modification in CVD and give a brief perspective on its prospective applications in CVD.",2020 Dec

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) provides a new method for BI-RADS categorisation. We analysed the ultrasonic morphological and texture characteristics of BI-RADS 4A benign and malignant lesions using AI, and these ultrasonic characteristics of BI-RADS 4A benign and malignant lesions were compared to examine the value of AI in the differential diagnosis of BI-RADS 4A benign and malignant lesions. Methods: A total of 206 lesions of BI-RADS 4A examined using ultrasonography were analysed retrospectively, including 174 benign lesions and 32 malignant lesions. All of the lesions were contoured manually, and the ultrasonic morphological and texture features of the lesions, such as circularity, height-to-width ratio, margin spicules, margin coarseness, margin indistinctness, margin lobulation, energy, entropy, grey mean, internal calcification and angle between the long axis of the lesion and skin, were calculated using grey level gradient co-occurrence matrix analysis. Differences between benign and malignant lesions of BI-RADS 4A were analysed. Results: Significant differences in margin lobulation, entropy, internal calcification and ALS were noted between the benign group and malignant group (P = 0.013, 0.045, 0.045, and 0.002, respectively). The malignant group had more margin lobulations and lower entropy compared with the benign group, and the benign group had more internal calcifications and a greater angle between the long axis of the lesion and skin compared with the malignant group. No significant differences in circularity, height-to-width ratio, margin spicules, margin coarseness, margin indistinctness, energy, and grey mean were noted between benign and malignant lesions. Conclusions: Compared with the naked eye, AI can reveal more subtle differences between benign and malignant BI-RADS 4A lesions. These results remind us carefully observation of the margin and the internal echo is of great significance. With the help of morphological and texture information provided by AI, doctors can make a more accurate judgment on such atypical benign and malignant lesions.",2020

Radiotherapy of the thorax is a known risk factor for cardiomyopathy; however, CHB is a rare complication. Here we present a case of a 46-year-old man who presented with CHB and was found to have significant cardiac fibrosis and calcification of the mitral valve annulus. His management required a multidisciplinary and multimodality approach to be able to identify childhood radiation as the cause of cardiomyopathy and establish a personalized management strategy with cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator.This case highlights radiation therapy as an important cause of cardiac conduction abnormalities even decades later, and the importance of extensive search for other reversible etiologies using the multimodality approach.",0
159,"Zhang C,Chen X,Wang JK,Li Y,Cui SJ,Wang Z,Luo T",Phenotypic Switching of Atherosclerotic Smooth Muscle Cells is Regulated by Activated PARP1-Dependent TET1 Expression.,"Aim: During the development of atherosclerosis, the vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) undergo phenotypic switching from contractile phenotype to synthetic phenotype. This study aimed at examining the role of DNA modification mediated by the oxidative stress dependent ten eleven translocation enzymes (TETs) expression at early stage of phenotypic switching. Methods: Based on the in vitro SMCs calcification model, DNA damage, phenotypic switching and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) were examined by comet assay, alkaline DNA unwinding assay, immunofluorescence staining, Dot blotting and Western blotting. Then Western blotting and qRT-PCR were performed to analyze the TETs expression and the relationship between the activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and TETs expression. We further alter 5hmC modification by inhibition of TET1 or PARP1 to rescue the phenotypic switching of SMCs using immunofluorescence staining, Dot blotting and qRT-PCR. We performed immunochemistry staining to examine the activated PARP1-TET1 pathway in vivo . Results: The phenotypic switching was observed in the SMCs cultured with calcification medium as the expression of the cell markers of contractile SMCs decreased and cell proliferation increased. In contrast, PAR and 5hmC were markedly increased in SMCs with calcification due to DNA damage. Our study further demonstrated that oxidative stress-activated PARP1, promotes TET1 expression and 5hmC increase during the phenotypic switching. Inhibition of TET1 or PARP1 can rescue the phenotypic switching of SMCs with calcification. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the important role of PARylation dependent 5hmC, in SMCs phenotypic switching. It raises the possibility to target TET1 and PARP1 for atherosclerosis treatment.",2021 Jul 1
160,"Fortunato RN,Robertson AM,Sang C,Duan X,Maiti S",Effect of macro-calcification on the failure mechanics of intracranial aneurysmal wall tissue.,"Background:: Calcification was recently found to be present in the majority of cerebral aneurysms, though how calcification and the presence or absence of co-localized lipid pools affect failure properties is still unknown. Objective:: The primary objective is to quantify the biomechanical effect of a macro-calcification with surrounding Near-Calcification Region (NCR) of varying mechanical properties on tissue failure behavior. Methods:: We utilized a structurally informed finite element model to simulate pre-failure and failure behavior of a human cerebral tissue specimen modeled as a composite containing a macro-calcification and surrounding NCR, embedded in a fiber matrix composite. Data from multiple imaging modalities was combined to quantify the collagen organization and calcification geometry. An idealized parametric model utilizing the calibrated model was used to explore the impact of NCR properties on tissue failure. Results:: Compared to tissue without calcification, peak stress was reduced by 82% and 49% for low modulus (representing lipid pool) and high modulus (simulating increase in calcification size) of the NCR, respectively. Failure process strongly depended on NCR properties with lipid pools blunting the onset of complete failure. When the NCR was calcified, the sample was able to sustain larger overall stress, however the failure process was abrupt with nearly simultaneous failure of the loaded fibers. Conclusions:: Failure of calcified vascular tissue is strongly influenced by the ultrastructure in the vicinity of the calcification. Computational modeling of failure in fibrous soft tissues can be used to understand how pathological changes impact the tissue failure process, with potentially important clinical implications.",2021 Jan
161,"van der Toorn JE,Rueda-Ochoa OL,van der Schaft N,Vernooij MW,Ikram MA,Bos D,Kavousi M",Arterial calcification at multiple sites: sex-specific cardiovascular risk profiles and mortality risk—the Rotterdam Study.,"Background: Evidence has pointed towards differences in the burden of arteriosclerosis according to its location and sex. Yet there is a scarcity of population-based data on aggregated sex-specific cardiovascular risk profiles, instead of single risk factors, and mortality risk according to the location of arteriosclerosis. We assessed sex-specific cardiovascular risk profiles and mortality risk associated with arteriosclerosis. Methods: From the population-based Rotterdam Study, 2357 participants (mean age 69 years, 53% women) underwent non-contrast computed tomography to quantify calcification, as a proxy for arteriosclerosis, in the coronary arteries (CAC), aortic arch (AAC), extracranial (ECAC) and intracranial carotid arteries (ICAC), vertebrobasilar arteries (VBAC), and aortic valve (AVC). Principal component analysis (PCA) of eight distinct cardiovascular risk factors was performed, separately for women and men, to derive risk profiles based on the shared variance between factors. We used sex-stratified multivariable logistic regression to examine the associations between PCA-derived risk profiles and severe calcification at different locations. We investigated the associations of severe calcification with mortality risk using sex-stratified multivariable Cox regression. Results: PCA identified three cardiovascular risk profiles in both sexes: (1) anthropometry, glucose, and HDL cholesterol; (2) blood pressure; and (3) smoking and total cholesterol. In women, the strongest associations were found for profile 2 with severe ECAC and ICAC (adjusted OR [95% CI] 1.32 [1.14–1.53]) and for profile 3 with severe at all locations, except AVC. In men, the strongest associations were found for profile 2 with VBAC (1.31 [1.12–1.52]) and profile 3 with severe AAC (1.28 [1.09–1.51]). ECAC and AVC in women and CAC in men showed the strongest, independent associations with cardiovascular mortality (HR [95% CI] 2.11 [1.22–3.66], 2.05 [1.21–3.49], 2.24 [1.21–3.78], respectively). Conclusions: Our findings further underline the existence of sex- and location-specific differences in the etiology and consequences of arteriosclerosis. Future research should unravel which distinct pathological processes underlie differences in risk profiles for arteriosclerosis.",2020
162,"Feldman V,Laish-Farkash A,Yosefy C",The relationship between plasma vitamin D level and heart valves calcification in acute coronary syndrome and non acute coronary syndrome patients.,"Background: There is conflicting data regarding the association between low levels of plasma vitamin D and ischemic heart disease. We aimed to investigate the relationship between plasma vitamin D levels and heart valve calcification in hospitalized patients with ischemic heart disease versus non-ischemic heart disease controls. Methods: A prospective case-control study comprising two age and gender-matched groups. The study group included consecutive patients hospitalized due to acute coronary syndrome; the control group included consecutive non-ischemic heart disease patients hospitalized for noncardiac causes. Blood samples for 25-hydroxyvitamin D level were drawn. An echocardiogram was performed during the first 3 days of hospitalization and reviewed for presence and degree of valvular calcification. Results: Forty patients with acute coronary syndrome and 40 controls (age 58 ± 11 years, 64% male in both groups) were included. Mean plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D vitamin level in the entire cohort was 24.5 ± 8 ng/ml. Valve calcification rates were similar in acute coronary syndrome versus non-acute coronary syndrome group (28 vs. 21 had valvular calcification; 18 vs. 12 had aortic valve calcification; 21 vs. 14 had mitral valve calcification, respectively; P = NS for all). We found no significant relationship between vitamin D level and valvular calcification, aortic valve calcification, or mitral valve calcification rate or degree in the entire cohort and in each group alone (P = NS for all). There was a negative correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and age in the acute coronary syndrome group (r = −0.399, P = 0.012). Conclusions: We did not find a significant relationship between plasma vitamin D levels and the rate or degree of calcification of either aortic/mitral/both valves in hospitalized patients with or without ischemic heart disease.",2021 Jun

However, its underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Methods: Clinical data were retrieved to analyse the association between calcification and bone metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Using multiple human breast cancer cell lines, the osteogenic cocktail model was established in vitro to demonstrate calcification-exacerbated metastasis. Migration and invasion characteristics were determined by wound healing and transwell migration. mRNA and protein expression were identified by quantitative PCR and western blotting. Metabolic alterations in breast cancer cells were evaluated using Seahorse Analyser. Results: The osteogenic differentiation of human breast cancer cells activated the classical TGF-β/Smad signalling pathway and the non-canonical MAPK pathway, which, in turn, exacerbated the progression of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). The metabolic programme switched to enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) upon osteogenic differentiation. Rotenone was used to inhibit the OXPHOS complex during osteogenesis to block mitochondrial function, consequently reversing the EMT phenotype. Conclusions: This study provides important insights into the mechanisms involved in breast cancer bone metastasis, and outlines a possible strategy to intervene in OXPHOS for the treatment of breast tumours.",2020 Nov 24
164,"Oh Y,Ahn CB,Cho WH,Yoon NY,Je JY",Anti-Osteoporotic Effects of Antioxidant Peptides PIISVYWK and FSVVPSPK from Mytilus edulis on Ovariectomized Mice.,"Numerous amounts of evidence suggest that bioactive peptides with diverse physiological activities can be nutraceuticals or potential drug candidates. In this study, blue mussel-derived antioxidant peptides PIISVYWK and FSVVPSPK were subjected to evaluate their osteogenic effect in mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (mBMMSCs) followed by an in vivo anti-osteoporotic effect. Treatment of PIISVYWK and FSVVPSPK on mBMMSCs stimulated alkaline phosphatase activity and calcification. Western blot results revealed that PIISVYWK and FSVVPSPK increased the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2/4 (BMP-2/4) followed by upregulating p-Smad1/5, type I collagen, and transcription factors including Runx2 and osterix in mBMMSCs. Two peptides also activated the phosphorylation of MAPKs (p-p38, p-ERK, and p-JNK). Treatment of MAPK inhibitors significantly inhibited the BMP signaling pathway, indicating that PIISVYWK and FSVVPSPK stimulated osteoblast differentiation of mBMMSCs through the MAPK-dependent BMP signaling pathway. The anti-osteoporotic effect of PIISVYWK and FSVVPSPK in ovariectomized (OVX) mice was investigated. Treatment of PIISVYWK and FSVVPSPK for ten weeks showed a notable anti-osteoporotic effect in OVX mice via increasing bone mineral density and other bone parameters compared to OVX mice without peptides. Serum analysis also showed that treatment of PIISVYWK and FSVVPSPK completely reduced osteocalcin and ALP (alkAline phosphatase) activity. Taken together, these results suggest that PIISVYWK and FSVVPSPK could be health-promoting functional food ingredients against osteoporosis.",2020 Sep
165,"Wortmann M,Arshad M,Hakimi M,Böckler D,Dihlmann S",Deficiency in Aim2 affects viability and calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells from murine aortas and angiotensin-II induced aortic aneurysms.,"Background: Phenotypic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells is a key element in vascular remodeling and aortic aneurysm growth. Previously, deletion of several inflammasome components decreased formation of aortic aneurysm (AA) in the Angiotensin II (AngII) -induced mouse model. We hypothesized that the inflammasome sensor Absent in melanoma 2 (Aim2) might affect the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), thereby reducing AA formation. Methods: Aim2−/− mice and wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6 J mice were used as an animal model. VSMC were isolated from 6 months old mice and grown in vitro. Young (passage 3–5) and senescent (passage 7–12) cells were analyzed in vitro for calcification in mineralization medium by Alizarin Red S staining. Expression of calcification and inflammatory markers were studied by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting, release of cytokines was determined by ELISA. To induce AA, osmotic mini-pumps loaded with AngII (1500 ng/kg bodyweight/min) were implanted for 28 days in male mice at 6 months of age. Results: Compared with VSMC from WT mice, VSMC isolated from Aim2−/− mice were larger, less viable, and underwent stronger calcification in mineralization medium, along with induction of Bmp4 and repression of Tnfsf11/Rankl gene expression. In addition, Aim2 deficiency was associated with reduced inflammasome gene expression and release of Interleukin-6. Using the mouse model of AngII induced AA, Aim2 deficiency reduced AA incidence to 48.4% (15/31) in Aim2−/− mice versus 76.5% (13/17) in WT mice. In contrast to Aim2−/− mice, AA from WT mice expressed significantly increased levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin/Acta2, indicating tissue remodeling. Reduced cell proliferation in Aim2−/− mice was indicated by significantly increased p16ink4a/Cdkn2a expression in untreated and AngII-infused aortas, and by significantly lower amounts of proliferating (Ki67 positive) VSMC in AngII-infused Aim2−/− mice. Conclusions: Our results suggest a role for Aim2 in regulating VSMC proliferation and transition to an osteoblast-like or osteoclast-like phenotype, thereby modulating the response of VSMC in aortic remodeling and AA formation.",2020

Methods: This retrospective, single-center study evaluated the outcomes of patients undergoing TEVAR, EVAR, or transcatheter aortic valve intervention with severe calcific arterial disease between July 2018 and August 2019. Maximum circumferential calcification, length of calcification, and inner/outer diameter measurements were collected with curved planar reformation by medical imaging software (Aquarius APS, TeraRecon, Foster City, Calif). Effective luminal gain was calculated using the minimal inner diameter and the largest bore passed within the vessel lumen. End points included technical success, mortality, adverse events, and requirement for bail out maneuvers. Technical success was defined as successful delivery and deployment of device or endograft. Results: Nine patients were included (mean age, 79.3 ± 9.79 years; range, 59-97 years]). four transcatheter aortic valve replacement, one TEVAR, one EVAR, and three fenestrated EVAR. Six patients (66.7%) had more than one artery treated; the segments treated included common iliac artery (seven patients [77.8%]), the external iliac artery (seven patients [77.8%]), and the common femoral artery (one patient [11.1%]). The average inner iliac vessel diameter was 3.38 ± 0.99 mm (range, 1.87-4.72 mm). The average outside diameter of device introduced was 7.2 ± 0.94 (range, 6.3-8.8 mm) with 229% effective luminal gain. Technical success was achieved in 100% of cases with a 0% mortality. Adjunctive measures were needed in five cases (55.6%). One vessel perforation was controlled with covered stent (Viabahn; W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) deployment. Dissection was identified in two cases requiring stent placement. Two cases required the use of the Terumo International Systems SOLOPATH Balloon Expandable TransFemoral System (Terumo Interventional Systems, Somerset, NJ). One case deployed a Viabahn stent applying the “crack and pave” technique. Conclusions: As the population of the United States ages, calcified arterial disease will become an everyday clinical conundrum. Furthermore, the procedures for which the IVL system is geared toward facilitating will likely also increase in use. The IVL system is an additional tool in the vascular surgeon's armamentarium to obtain large-bore access in these calcified vessels. Further studies are needed to better assess the clinical effectiveness of the IVL system.",2021 Mar

Yet, it is unclear if atherosclerosis is associated with a subsequent higher cancer risk. We determined the association of atherosclerotic calcification in the aortic arch, as proxy for systemic atherosclerosis, with the risk of cancer.Methods: Between 2003 and 2006, 2,404 participants (mean age: 69.5 years, 52.5% women) from the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study underwent computed tomography to quantify calcification in the aortic arch. Participants were followed for the onset of cancer, death, loss to follow-up, or January 1st, 2015, whichever came first. We computed sex-specific tertiles of aortic arch calcification volumes. Next, we examined the association between the volume and severity (i.e., tertiles) of aortic arch calcification and the risk of cancer using Cox proportional hazard models.Results: During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 9.6 years (8.9–10.5), 348 participants were diagnosed with cancer. Participants with the greatest severity of aortic arch calcification had a higher risk of cancer [hazard ratio for the third tertile compared to the first tertile of aortic arch calcification volume in the total population is 1.39 (95% CI = 1.04–1.86)].Conclusions: Individuals with the most severe aortic arch calcification had a higher risk of cancer. While this could reflect the impact of long-term exposure to shared risk factors, it might also point toward the co-occurrence of both conditions.",2020

However, modeling healthy and pathological aging of the human vasculature represents an unresolved experimental challenge. Here, we generated induced vascular endothelial cells (iVECs) and smooth muscle cells (iSMCs) by direct reprogramming of healthy human fibroblasts from donors of different ages and Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) patients. iVECs induced from old donors revealed upregulation of GSTM1 and PALD1, genes linked to oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial junction stability, as vascular aging markers. A functional assay performed on PALD1 KD VECs demonstrated a recovery in vascular permeability. We found that iSMCs from HGPS donors overexpressed bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)−4, which plays a key role in both vascular calcification and endothelial barrier damage observed in HGPS. Strikingly, BMP4 concentrations are higher in serum from HGPS vs. age-matched mice. Furthermore, targeting BMP4 with blocking antibody recovered the functionality of the vascular barrier in vitro, hence representing a potential future therapeutic strategy to limit cardiovascular dysfunction in HGPS. These results show that iVECs and iSMCs retain disease-related signatures, allowing modeling of vascular aging and HGPS in vitro.",2020

Here, we report the case of a 59‐year‐old male patient with a well defined 30 mm calcified nodule in his right upper lung lobe and calcified mediastinal lymph nodes. The mass was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by transbronchial biopsy. He received systemic chemotherapy, followed by lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. During surgery, the lymph nodes were tightly adherent to the superior vena cava with invasion of the vascular wall. Pathological diagnosis confirmed acinar adenocarcinoma and psammoma bodies (PBs). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed tumor cells positive for parathyroid hormone‐related proteins 1 and 2. Calcification of primary lung adenocarcinoma is rare. We report a calcified lesion where the secretion of parathyroid hormone by the tumor may have caused the accumulation of PBs. Calcification of metastatic lymph nodes may increase the risk of adhesion, requiring care during surgery. Key points: Significant findings of the studyLung adenocarcinoma with extensive calcification in primary and metastatic lymph node lesions is rare and the mechanism involved is poorly understood. Of significance, calcification in our case was related to parathyroid hormone‐related proteins 1 and 2 secreted by the tumor.What this study addsThis study suggests the potential role of parathyroid hormone‐related proteins in lung tumor calcification. The implications for clinicians are that calcified metastatic lymph nodes and tumors might be tightly fused to tissues. Therefore, surgery should be conducted with care.",2020 Oct

Here, we aimed to investigate a possible role for miR-34c in the development of osteogenic differentiation during CAVD and to find out the underlying mechanisms. Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) were isolated from the clinical aortic valve tissue samples of CAVD patients and patients with acute aortic dissection and collected. Then, RT-qPCR was performed to determine miR-34c expression and western blot analysis was applied to confirm the relevant protein expression in these VICs. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to confirm the relation between miR-34c and STC1. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and alizarin red staining was performed to further confirm the degree of calcification in these samples. MiR-34c was lowly expressed and STC1 was highly expressed in the CAVD tissues. Furthermore, STC1 was the target of miR-34c and was negatively regulated by miR-34c. Overexpression of miR-34c in VICs was concomitant with suppression of both STC1 expression and phosphorylation level of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In addition, significant decrease of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) and osteocalcin, as well as the decrease of calcification degree were also observed in VICs with miR-34c overexpressed. Taken together, miR-34c could inhibit osteogenic differentiation and calcification of VICs by suppressing the STC1/JNK signaling pathway in CAVD, making miR-34c a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CAVD.",2020

Methods: An online survey was offered to EUSOBI members, with 17 questions focused on demographics, level of experience, clinical setting, awareness of BAC association with cardiovascular risk, mammographic reporting, modality of BAC assessment, and action habits. Descriptive statistics were used. Results: Among 1084 EUSOBI members, 378 (34.9%) responded to the survey, 361/378 (95.5%) radiologists, 263 females (69.6%), 112 males (29.6%), and 3 (0.8%) who did not specify their gender. Of 378 respondents, 305 (80.7%) declared to be aware of BAC meaning in terms of cardiovascular risk and 234 (61.9%) to routinely include BAC in mammogram reports, when detected. Excluding one inconsistent answer, simple annotation of BAC presence was declared by 151/233 (64.8%), distinction between low versus extensive BAC burden by 59/233 (25.3%), and usage of an ordinal scale by 22/233 (9.5%) and of a cardinal scale by 1/233 (0.4%).

These two types of imaging agents allow detection of bone metastases (based on the presence of HAp) and vascular calcification lesions (that contain HAp and other calcium minerals). With the aim of developing a cyclotron-independent PET radiotracer for these lesions, with broad calcium mineral affinity and simple one-step radiolabeling, we developed [68Ga]Ga-THP-Pam. Radiolabeling with 68Ga is achieved using a mild single-step kit (5 min, room temperature, pH 7) to high radiochemical yield and purity (>95%). NMR studies demonstrate that Ga binds via the THP chelator, leaving the BP free to bind to its biological target. [68Ga]Ga-THP-Pam shows high stability in human serum. The calcium mineral binding of [68Ga]Ga-THP-Pam was compared in vitro to two other 68Ga-BPs which have been successfully evaluated in humans, [68Ga]Ga-NO2APBP and [68Ga]Ga-BPAMD, as well as [18F]NaF. Interestingly, we found that all 68Ga-BPs have a high affinity for a broad range of calcium minerals implicated in vascular calcification disease, while [18F]NaF is selective for HAp. Using healthy young mice as a model of metabolically active growing calcium mineral in vivo, we compared the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of [68Ga]Ga-THP-Pam with [18F]NaF as well as [68Ga]NO2APBP. These studies revealed that [68Ga]Ga-THP-Pam has high in vivo affinity for bone tissue (high bone/muscle and bone/blood ratios) and fast blood clearance (t1/2 < 10 min) comparable to both [68Ga]NO2APBP and [18F]NaF. Overall, [68Ga]Ga-THP-Pam shows high potential for clinical translation as a cyclotron-independent calcium mineral PET radiotracer, with simple and efficient radiochemistry that can be easily implemented in any radiopharmacy.",2021 Jul 21
173,"De D,Dutta S,Tarafdar S,Kar SS,Das U,Basu K,Mukhopadhyay P,Ghosh S",Comparison between Sonographic Features and Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology with Histopathology in the Diagnosis of Solitary Thyroid Nodule.,"Background:: High resolution ultrasonography (USG) is the first-line investigation in evaluation of euthyroid nodules. Thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TIRADS) is an USG-based risk stratification system for classifying thyroid nodules. Subjects with high-risk category of TIRADS undergo fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and FNAC findings are reported according to Bethesda classification. Bethesda categories are used for determining risk of malignancy. Data regarding sonographic classification of thyroid nodule and its cytological association with respect to final histopathological diagnosis remains scarcely available in India. Aims and Objective:: The study evaluated euthyroid nodules for risk of malignancy and compared sonographic features and FNAC (Bethesda classification) findings with histopathology of excised samples. Material and Methods:: This was a single-center observational study on 137 consecutive subjects of solitary euthyroid nodule. All subjects underwent USG according to TIRADS and FNAC where applicable. Surgical biopsy report was used as a gold standard. Results:: The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive and negative predictive value of FNAC were 80%, 90%, 85%, 86%, and 86.6% and TIRADS were 80%, 47.2% 61%, 51.3%, and 77.3%, respectively. FNAC classification was equally sensitive and more specific than TIRADS. Among individual USG parameters, micro-calcification was most sensitive (80%) and specific (86%). Irregular margin and taller-than-wider shape had a specificity of 89% and 92%, respectively. 3 patients (14.28%) with benign cytology and suspicious USG features (specifically TIRADS 4 & 5) undergoing surgery had malignancy in final HPE. Conclusions:: USG and FNAC are equally sensitive in diagnosing malignant thyroid nodule but FNA is more specific (90%). It's a minimally invasive method which can be used to distinguish malignant from benign lesions with a high degree of accuracy (85%). In patient having high risk feature on USG, a benign cytology needs to be repeat FNAC and they should undergo surgical biopsy for confirmation.",2020 Jul-Aug
174,"Su QH,Zhang Y,Shen B,Li YC,Tan J",Application of molybdenum target X-ray photography in imaging analysis of caudal intervertebral disc degeneration in rats.,"BACKGROUND: Conventional plain X-ray images of rats, the most common animals used as degeneration models, exhibit unclear vertebral structure and blurry intervertebral disc spaces due to their small size, slender vertebral bodies. AIM: To apply molybdenum target X-ray photography in the evaluation of caudal intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration in rat models. METHODS: Two types of rat caudal IVD degeneration models (needle-punctured model and endplate-destructed model) were established, and their effectiveness was verified using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Molybdenum target inspection and routine plain X-ray were then performed on these models. Additionally, four observers were assigned to measure the intervertebral height of degenerated segments on molybdenum target plain X-ray images and routine plain X-ray images, respectively. The degeneration was evaluated and statistical analysis was subsequently conducted. RESULTS: Nine rats in the needle-punctured model and 10 rats in the endplate-destructed model were effective. Compared with routine plain X-ray images, molybdenum target plain X-ray images showed higher clarity, stronger contrast, as well as clearer and more accurate structural development. The McNemar test confirmed that the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.031). In the two models, the reliability of the intervertebral height measured by the four observers on routine plain X-ray images was poor (ICC < 0.4), while the data obtained from the molybdenum target plain X-ray images were more reliable. CONCLUSION: Molybdenum target inspection can obtain clearer images and display fine calcification in the imaging evaluation of caudal IVD degeneration in rats, thus ensuring a more accurate evaluation of degeneration.",2020 Aug 26

Methods: A series of 1002 consecutive brain computed tomography (CT) scans of patients with known primary tumors was retrospectively assessed. CBM were defined by the presence of calcification within intra-axial-enhancing lesions; identification of CBM was based on visual examination and ROI analysis (> 85 Hounsfield units). Also, calcifications in the primary tumor of all patients with brain metastases were evaluated. In CBM patients, we investigated the type of calcifications (punctate, nodular, cluster, ring, coarse), the histology of primary tumor, and if a previous RT was performed. Results: Among 190 (18.9%) patients with brain metastatic disease, 34 presented with CBM (17.9%). Sixteen patients were previously treated with RT, while 18 presented calcifications ab initio (9.5% of all brain metastases). The majority of patients with CBM had a primitive lung adenocarcinoma (56%), followed by breast ductal invasive carcinoma (20%) and small cell lung carcinoma (11.8%). CBM were single in 44.1% of patients and multiple in 55.9%. With regard to the type of calcifications, the majority of CBM were punctate, without specific correlations between calcification type and histology of primary tumor. No patients with ab initio CBM had calcifications in primary tumor. Conclusion: In conclusion, our data show that CBM are more common than usually thought, showing an incidence of 9.5% ab initio in patients with brain metastases. This study underlines that neuroradiologists should not overlook intraparenchymal brain calcifications, especially in oncologic patients. Key Points: • Among the differential diagnosis of brain intraparenchymal calcifications, metastases are considered uncommon and found predominantly in patients treated with radiotherapy (RT).• Our data show that CBM are more common than usually thought, showing an incidence of 9.5% ab initio in patients with brain metastases.• A proportion of intraparenchymal brain calcifications, especially in oncologic patients, might represent evolving lesions and neuroradiologists should not overlook them to avoid a delay in diagnosis and treatment.",2021
176,"Bi X,Yang K,Zhang B,Zhao J",The Protective Role of Klotho in CKD-Associated Cardiovascular Disease.,"Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in advanced CKD. The major pathological changes of CKD-associated CVD are severe vascular media calcification, aberrant cardiac remodeling such as hypertrophy and fibrosis, as well as accelerated atherosclerosis. α-Klotho is proposed as an anti-aging gene, which is primarily expressed in the kidney. Recent studies reveal that α-Klotho deficiency is associated with profound cardiovascular dysfunction. Of note, CKD represents extremely declined α-Klotho levels, hinting that α-Klotho deficiency may be implicated in the pathogenesis of CKD-associated CVD. Summary: Based on the pathogenic mechanism of α-Klotho deficiency and decreased Klotho levels in the circulation even early in stage 1 of CKD, α-Klotho serves as a sensitive biomarker for renal insufficiency and also a novel predictor of risk of overall mortality of CVD events in CKD. Meanwhile, loss of Klotho resulted from kidney dysfunction markedly contributes to the progressive development of CKD and CVD. By contrast, prevention of Klotho decline using exogenous supplementation or genetically activated ways by several mechanisms can dramatically mitigate cardiac dysfunction, prevent vascular calcification, and retard the progression of CKD-accelerated atherosclerosis. Key Messages: Klotho deficiency is proposed as a novel predictive biomarker as well as a pathogenic contributor to CVD events in CKD. In the future, Klotho may be a crucial potential therapeutic strategy to decrease the burden of CVD comorbidity with CKD in clinics.",2020 Nov

The lesion was a 4.6-cmsized palpable, hyperechoic, calcified mass with posterior shadowing on ultrasonography. This finding is a unique feature of mucinous breast carcinoma and is also observed in unusual breast cancer variants such as metaplastic breast cancer with chondroid differentiation, extraosseous osteosarcoma, and breast chondrosarcoma. The lesion showed a slow-growing pattern throughout the 4-year observation period. Mammography performed 4 years ago revealed faint, grouped microcalcifications; the lesion increased in size over 2 years, presenting as a well-circumscribed, calcified mass, mimicking dystrophic calcification. As several unusual variants of breast cancer, including mucinous carcinoma, may present as coarse and densely calcified masses on mammography, immediate biopsy should be considered when they are observed.",2020 Sep

A 69 year-old woman presented with intermittent left upper quadrant pain. CT imaging revealed a 1 cm solid lesion in the pancreatic tail with peripheral calcification. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy showed a proliferation of epithelial cells with fibrovascular cores. An immunohistochemical stain for p40 was positive in the lesional cells. A distal pancreatectomy revealed a unilocular, cystic, well-circumscribed, soft and friable mass measuring 1.0 × 1.0 × 0.8 cm. Histologically, the cyst was lined by nonkeratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with a complex papillary architecture, filling the cyst lumen. Molecular sequencing revealed a KRAS G12V missense mutation. While the lesion shared some histologic features with the previously described “squamoid cyst of the pancreatic ducts”, the complex papillary architecture and presence of a KRAS mutation are unique to the entity we describe herein and we propose the name “intraductal papillary squamous neoplasm of the pancreas.” Reporting the cytomorphologic features of this novel entity may help in identification of similar lesions and understanding of the clinicopathologic significance.",2020 Oct

The authors investigated whether supplementation with vitamin K, a cofactor for proteins that inhibit vascular calcification, could improve arterial stiffness in patients with CKD, in a parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving patients aged 18 or older with CKD stage 3b or 4. Vitamin K2 supplementation for 12 months did not improve vascular stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity. An updated meta-analysis including these new results confirmed a lack of efficacy of vitamin K supplementation on these end points. Longer treatment periods or therapies other than vitamin K may be required to improve vascular calcification and reduce arterial stiffness and cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD.",2020 Oct
180,"Pan J,Tong W,Luo J,Liang J,Pan F,Zheng Y,Xie X",Does contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) play a better role in diagnosis of breast lesions with calcification? A comparison with MRI.,"Objective:: To compare the efficacy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound enabled reclassification of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (CEUS-BI-RADS) with MRI in the diagnosis of breast lesions with calcification. Methods:: A total of 52 breast lesions with calcification from 51 patients were detected by ultrasound as hyperechoic foci and categorized as BI-RADS 3–5. The 51 patients further underwent CEUS scan and MRI. The ultrasound-BI-RADS combined with CEUS 5-point score system redefined the classification of BI-RADS which was called CEUS-BI-RADS. The diagnostic efficacy of three methods was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Histopathological assessment used as the gold-standard. Results:: The sensitivities of Ultrasound-BI-RADS, MRI classification of BI-RADS (MRI-BI-RADS) and CEUS-BI-RADS were 85%, 90% and 95% without significant difference among the three modalities (p > 0.05). The diagnostic specificities of ultrasound-BI-RADS, MRI-BI-RADS and CEUS-BI-RADS were 78.1%, 78.1% and 96.8%, respectively (p < 0.05); and the accuracy were 80.7%, 82.6% and 96.1% for ultrasound-BI-RADS, MRI-BI-RADS and CEUS-BI-RADS, respectively (p < 0.05). The area under ROC (AUROC) in differentiation of breast lesions with calcification was 0.945 for CEUS-BI-RADS, 0.907 for MRI-BI-RADS and 0.853 for ultrasound-BI-RADS, with no significant difference among the three modalities (p > 0.05). Conclusion:: The CEUS-BI-RADS has a better diagnostic efficiency than MRI-BI-RADS in the differentiation of the breast lesions with calcification. Advances in knowledge:: •CEUS is a better method in differentiation of breast lesions with calcification.•CEUS-BI-RADS increases the efficiency of diagnosis compared to MRI.",2020 Aug 01

It can result in rigidity of the vasculature and an increase in cardiac events. Here, we report that the microRNA miR‐134‐5p potentiates inorganic phosphate (Pi)‐induced calcium deposition in VSMCs by inhibiting histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5). Using miRNA microarray analysis of Pi‐treated rat VSMCs, we first selected miR‐134‐5p for further evaluation. Quantitative RT‐PCR confirmed that miR‐134‐5p was increased in Pi‐treated A10 cells, a rat VSMC line. Transfection of miR‐134‐5p mimic potentiated the Pi‐induced increase in calcium contents. miR‐134‐5p increased the amounts of bone runt‐related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) protein and bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) mRNA in the presence of Pi but decreased the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG). Bioinformatic analysis showed that the HDAC5 3′untranslated region (3′UTR) was one of the targets of miR‐134‐5p. The luciferase construct containing the 3′UTR of HDAC5 was down‐regulated by miR‐134‐5p mimic in a dose‐dependent manner in VSMCs. Overexpression of HDAC5 mitigated the calcium deposition induced by miR‐134‐5p. Our results suggest that a Pi‐induced increase of miR‐134‐5p may cause vascular calcification through repression of HDAC5.",2020 Sep

Its association with breast cancer is even less frequent. We present the case of a 50-year-old female patient diagnosed in 2010 with stage IIA infiltrating ductal breast cancer RE (-), RP (+), HER 2 (-), HER2 NEU (+). She was treated with modified radical left breast mastectomy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Her condition began presenting oppressive frontal headache without irradiation, predominantly in the evening, intensity 8/10, which decreased when sleeping and was exacerbated with stressful situations, in addition to progressive cognitive deterioration. Simple and contrasted computed tomography (CT) of the skull and thoracoabdominal were requested, showing multiple micronodular lesions with calcium density in the brain parenchyma, left pleural effusion, hypo and hyperdense lesions in the liver parenchyma, as well as osteoblastic lesions in the lumbar spine. Simple and contrasted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the skull showed multiple supra and infratentorial intra-axial lesions. The most frequent associated symptom with miliary metastasis is cognitive impairment. Miliary metastasis, confirmed by imaging studies and histopathology, requires the ruling out of other causes of this calcification pattern, such as neurocysticercosis, due to specific treatment for each pathology.",0

Teratomas are found in the ovaries and testes. Retroperitoneal teratoma is rare, especially adrenal teratoma. Here, we describe a rare case of a 17-year-old woman who was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and a right adrenal mass at the age of eight. So, she received anti-tuberculosis treatment. Nine years later, chest X-rays showed prior lesions in both lungs, and abdominal CT showed the mass in the right adrenal gland was larger than before, during this period she had no clinical symptoms. She underwent retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy, and the pathological diagnosis was a mature teratoma of the right adrenal gland. During a one-year follow-up, the patients recovered well without any discomfort. Thirty-two cases were found in the literature review, among which no patients had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. Adrenal teratoma is often seen in females and the left adrenal gland. The imaging features of adrenal teratoma can be cystic, solid, and cystic solids. Mature fat and calcification can be seen in most teratomas.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 45 patients with pathologically or GeneXpert-confirmed BTB from January 2010 to December 2017. We assessed the US features of target lesions including size, shape, orientation, margin, echogenicity, calcification, posterior acoustic features, and blood-flow signal. Results: The patients were classified with nodular (55.5%, 25/45), abscess (15.6%, 7/45), or sinus (28.9%, 13/45) type according to their US features. Forty lesions (88.9%, 40/45) extended in a parallel orientation and five extended in a non-parallel orientation. Calcifications were found in eight cases, including six macrocalcifications and two microcalcifications. Enlarged axillary lymph nodes were observed in three cases (6.7%, 3/45). In addition, 44 of the 45 cases (97.8%, 44/45) exhibited hypovascularity or avascularity according to color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI). Conclusion: BTB lesions can be classified as nodular, abscess, or sinus type according to their US imaging features. Poor blood supply detected by CDFI might be a common US feature of BTB.

185,"Fushimi A,Takeyama H,Tachibana T,Manome Y",Osteogenic cocktail induces calcifications in human breast cancer cell line via placental alkaline phosphatase expression.,"Breast cancer is frequently characterized by calcifications in mammography. The mechanism for calcifications in breast cancer is not completely known. Understanding this mechanism will improve diagnostic accuracy. Herein, we demonstrated that calcifications occur and that alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity increases in MDA-MB-231 cells cultured using an osteogenic cocktail-containing medium. Microarray transcript analysis showed that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was significantly involved, with recruitment of placental alkaline phosphatase. Calcifications and alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity were suppressed by silencing placental alkaline phosphatase using a small interfering RNA. Inhibition of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway suppressed phospho-c-Jun and placental alkaline phosphatase and resulted in absence of calcifications. These findings reveal that breast cancer cells acquire alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity via placental alkaline phosphatase expression and suggest that breast calcification formation is closely associated with the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.",2020

We conducted a systematic review to assess the associations between BAC and CAD and its risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking). Methods and findings: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and references of relevant papers were searched up to 18 February 2020 for English language studies that evaluated the associations of BAC and CAD and its risk factors. A single reviewer extracted all data and assessed study quality with verification by another independent reviewer, if required. Across 31 studies (n = 35,583; 3 longitudinal and 28 cross-sectional studies) that examined the association of BAC and CAD, the OR was 2.61 (95% CI 2.12–3.21; I2 = 71%). Sub-analysis of studies that graded BAC severity using the 4- (4 studies) or 12-point scale systems (3 studies) revealed an association with CAD and moderate-severe BAC (OR 4.83 (95%CI 1.50–15.54) and OR 2.95 (95%CI 1.49–5.84), respectively) but not mild BAC (OR 2.04 (95%CI 0.82–5.05) and OR 1.08 (95%CI 0.42–2.75), respectively). BAC was associated with hypertension (42 studies; n = 32,646; OR 1.80; 95% CI 1.47–2.21; I2 = 85%) and diabetes mellitus (51 studies; n = 53,464; OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.82–2.59; I2 = 75%) but not with hypercholesterolemia (OR 1.31; 95%CI 0.97–1.77; I2 = 67%). Smoking was inversely associated with BAC (35 studies; n = 40,002; OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42–0.70; I2 = 83%). Studies mostly included symptomatic women. Marked heterogeneity existed and publication bias may be present. Conclusions: BAC is associated with CAD, diabetes mellitus and hypertension and inversely associated with smoking. Whether BAC could screen for CAD cannot be determined from current published data due to the lack of larger prospective studies.

In most cases, the management of flat epithelial atypia (FEA) and atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) after VABB with residual calcifications requires surgical excision. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of pathology of non-calcified specimens on the underestimation of malignancy. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 1147 consecutive cases of stereotactic VABB of suspicious calcifications without mass from January 2010 to December 2016 and identified 46 (4.0%) FEA and 52 (4.5%) ADH cases that were surgically excised for the retrieval of residual calcifications. Mammographic features and pathology of the calcified and non-calcified specimens were reviewed. Results: Seventeen specimens (17.3%) were upgraded to malignancy. Mammographic features associated with the underestimation of malignancy were calcification extent (> 34.5 mm: odds ratio = 6.059, p = 0.026). According to the pathology of calcified versus non-calcified specimens, four risk groups were identified: Group A (ADH vs. high-risk lesions), Group B (ADH vs. non-high-risk lesions), Group C (FEA vs. high-risk lesions), and Group D (FEA vs. non-high-risk lesions). The lowest underestimation rate was observed in Group D (Group A vs. Group B vs. Group C vs. Group D: 35.0% vs. 20.0% vs. 15.0% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.041, respectively). Conclusion: Considering that the calcification extent and pathology of non-calcified specimens may be beneficial in determining the likelihood of malignancy underestimation, excision after FEA or ADH diagnosis by VABB is required, except for the diagnoses of FEA coexisting without atypia lesions in non-calcified specimens.",2020 Nov

Coronary calcification is seen as an aetiopathological event in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Studies have shown that breast artery calcification, which is routinely found in mammography of elderly women, could be predictive of coronary artery calcification. Material and methods: In this cross-sectional study, 60 women over 40 years of age were included. All of these patients had undergone mammography after having an indication to undergo a computed tomography-angiography. Breast arterial calcification and calcium scores were determined for each patient, and the paired-t test was used to analyse the data. Results: The mean age of patients was 49.52 ± 8.83 years. Of these 60 women, 50% were postmenopausal and 50% were not. In 37 (61.7%) cases, mild to severe coronary calcification was observed, and 50 (83.3%) had mild to severe breast arterial calcification. There was a significant correlation between coronary calcification and breast artery calcification (p = 0.001), and there was also a significant relationship between coronary calcification and postmenopausal calcification (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Breast artery calcification can be a suitable predictor for coronary artery calcification and is a valid method for predicting cardiovascular disease probability in the future.",2020

Atherosclerosis is a chronic progressive inflammatory process, and it mainly presents with lipid accumulation, foam cell proliferation, inflammatory response, atherosclerotic plaque formation and rupture, thrombosis, and vascular calcification. Therefore, there is a great need for reliable therapeutic drugs or remedies to cure or alleviate atherosclerosis and reduce the societal burden. Ginsenosides are natural steroid glycosides and triterpene saponins obtained mainly from the plant ginseng. Several recent studies have reported that ginsenosides have a variety of pharmacological activities against several diseases including inflammation, cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

Activity of endogenous calcification inhibitors such as matrix gla protein (MGP) is dependent on vitamin K. RTRs commonly have subclinical vitamin K deficiency. The Vitamin K in kidney Transplant Organ Recipients: Investigating vEssel Stiffness (ViKTORIES) study assesses whether vitamin K supplementation reduces vascular stiffness and calcification in a diverse population of RTR. Methods and analysis: ViKTORIES (ISRCTN22012044) is a single-centre, phase II, parallel-group, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effect of vitamin K supplementation in 90 prevalent RTR. Participants are eligible if they have a functioning renal transplant for >1 year. Those on warfarin, with atrial fibrillation, estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or contraindications to MRI are excluded. Treatment is with vitamin K (menadiol diphosphate) 5 mg three times per week for 1 year or matching placebo. All participants have primary and secondary endpoint measures at 0 and 12 months. The primary endpoint is ascending aortic distensibility on cardiac MR imaging. Secondary endpoints include vascular calcification (coronary artery calcium score by CT), cardiac structure and function on MR, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, serum uncarboxylated MGP, transplant function, proteinuria and quality of life. The study is powered to detect 1.0×10–3 mm Hg-1 improvement in ascending aortic distensibility in the vitamin K group relative to placebo at 12 months. Analyses will be conducted as between-group differences at 12 months by intention to treat. Discussion: This trial may identify a novel, inexpensive and low-risk treatment to improve surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk in RTR.",2020

This prospective single institution study included asymptomatic women over 40 who underwent CCTA and breast cancer screening mammography between July 2018 and April 2019. CAD-RADS was scored based on Deep Learning (DL). Mammograms were assessed visually for the presence of BAC. A total of 213 patients were included in the analysis. In comparison to the low CAD-RADS (CAD-RADS < 3) group, the high CAD-RADS (CAD-RADS ≥ 3) group, more often had a history of hypertension (P = 0.036), diabetes (P = 0.017), and chronic kidney disease (P = 0.006). They also had a significantly higher level of LDL-C (P = 0.024), while HDL-C was lower than in the low CAD-RADS group (P = 0.003). BAC was also significantly higher in the high CAD-RADS group (P = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, the presence of BAC [odd ratio (OR) 10.22, 95% CI 2.86–36.49, P < 0.001] maintained a significant associations with CAD-RADS after adjustment by meaningful variable. The same tendency was also found after adjustment by all covariates.

Hyperphosphatemia leads to increased intracellular phosphorus influx, which leads to an increase in osteoblast-like cells in vascular smooth muscle cell. PiT-1 transports phosphate in vascular smooth muscle cell. However, the mechanism of vascular calcification is not completely understood. This study investigated candidate phosphorus-related molecules other than PiT-1. We hypothesized that phosphorus-related molecules belonging to the solute-carrier (SLC) superfamily would be involved in vascular calcification. As a result of DNA microarray analysis, we focused on SLC37A2 and showed that mRNA expression of these cells increased on calcified aotic smooth muscle cells (AoSMC). SLC37A2 has been reported to transport both glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate and phosphate/phosphate exchanges. In vitro analysis showed that SLC37A2 expression was not affected by inflammation on AoSMC. The expression of SLC37A2 mRNA and protein increased in calcified AoSMC. In vivo analysis showed that SLC37A2 mRNA expression in the aorta of chronic kidney disease rats was correlated with osteogenic marker genes. Furthermore, SLC37A2 was expressed at the vascular calcification area in chronic kidney disease rats. As a result, we showed that SLC37A2 is one of the molecules that increase with vascular calcification in vitro and in vivo.",2021 Jan

We alternately deposited two- or three-layer cationic polyelectrolyte (PE) and anionic PE films on the surface of SKOV-3 and HeLa cells. Then, a mineral shell (calcium carbonate, CaCO3) was formed on the surface of polymer shells via electrostatic force and biomineralization. The CCK-8 assay results and live/dead staining showed that the surface shells strongly aggravated the cytotoxicity. The monolayer scratch wound migration assay results and immunofluorescence staining results showed that the shells, especially the mineral shells, could efficiently inhibit the migration of SKOV-3 and HeLa cells without any anticancer drugs. The immunofluorescence results of the three small G proteins of the cells showed that the immunofluorescence intensity in SKOV-3 did not change. Preliminary results from our laboratory showed an increase in MMP-9 secreted by cancer cells after coating with films or mineral shells. It suggests that mechanisms that inhibit cell migration are related to the MMP signaling pathway. All the results indicated that shellization (films or nanomineral shells) but not limited to calcification can be used as one of the tools to change the function of cells.",2020 Jul 21

The predictive powers of noninvasive predictors for high-grade DCIS remain contradictory. This study aimed to explore the predictive value of calcification for high-grade DCIS in Chinese patients.This was a retrospective study of Chinese DCIS patients recruited from the Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University between January and December 2018. The patients were divided into calcification and non-calcification groups based on the mammography results. The correlation of calcification with the pathologic stage of DCIS was evaluated using the multivariable analysis. The predictive value of calcification for DCIS grading was examined using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve.The pathologic grade of DCIS was not associated with calcification morphology (P = .902), calcification distribution (P = .252), or breast density (P = .188). The multivariable analysis showed that the presence of calcification was independently associated with high pathologic grade of DCIS (OR = 3.206, 95% CI = 1.315–7.817, P = .010), whereas the age, hypertension, menopause, and mammography BI-RADS were not (all P > .05) associated with the grade of DCIS. The ROC analysis of the predictive value of calcification for DCIS grading showed that the area under the curve was 0.626 (P = .019), with a sensitivity of 73.1%, specificity of 52.2%, positive predictive value of 72.2%, and negative predictive value of 53.3%.The presence of calcification is independently associated with high pathologic grade of DCIS and could predict high-grade DCIS in Chinese patients.",2020 Jul 10

Selenium (Se) may decrease the risk of CCD, and previous studies confirmed that Se-containing protein from Se-enriched Spirulina platensis (Se-SP) exhibited novel antioxidant potential. However, the effect of Se-SP against VC has been not investigated. Herein, the protective effect and underlying mechanism of Se-SP against high glucose-induced calcification in mouse aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (MOVAS) were explored. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) results showed time-dependent uptake of Se-SP in MOVAS cells, which significantly inhibited high glucose-induced abnormal proliferation. Se-SP co-treatment also effectively attenuated high glucose-induced calcification of MOVAS cells, followed by decreased activity and expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Further investigation revealed that Se-SP markedly prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated DNA damage in glucose-treated MOVAS cells. ROS inhibition by glutathione (GSH) effectively inhibited high glucose-induced calcification, indicating that Se-SP could act as ROS inhibitor to inhibit high glucose-induced DNA damage and calcification. Moreover, Se-SP dramatically attenuated high glucose-induced dysfunction of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT (PI3K/AKT) pathways. Se-SP after Se addition achieved enhanced potential in inhibiting high glucose-induced calcification, which validated that Se-SP as a new Se species could be a highly effective treatment for human CCD.",2020

We retrospectively included 35 consecutive FTCs with distant metastases and 134 FTCs without distant metastasis. We extracted a total of 60 radiomics features derived from the first order, shape, gray-level cooccurrence matrix, and gray-level size zone matrix features using US imaging. A radiomics signature was generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and was used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier in five-fold cross-validation. The SVM classifier showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 on average on the test folds. Age, size, widely invasive histology, extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastases on pathology, nodule-in-nodule appearance, marked hypoechogenicity, and rim calcification on the US were significantly more frequent among FTCs with distant metastasis compared to those without metastasis (p < 0.05). Radiomics signature and widely invasive histology were significantly associated with distant metastasis on multivariate analysis (p < 0.01 and p = 0.003). The classifier using the results of the multivariate analysis showed an AUC of 0.93. The radiomics signature from thyroid ultrasound is an independent biomarker for noninvasively predicting distant metastasis of FTC.",2020 Jul

Increasing evidence indicates that numerous microRNAs (miRs/miRNAs) are involved in BAV calcification via their target genes. miR-330-3p was found to be involved in the deterioration of BAV calcification by miR profiling in human calcified BAV and tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) tissues in the present study and the underlying mechanism was investigated. RNA sequencing was performed on four BAV and four TAV tissues from patients with aortic stenosis before these leaflets were examined for the expression levels of miR-330-3p and CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) by reverse transcription-PCR. The alteration of functional factors associated with calcification was also assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry in human aortic tissue samples. The putative target of miR-330-3p was detected by dual-luciferase assay in 293 cells. Furthermore, the influence of miR-330-3p expression on osteogenic progression was explored in cultured porcine valve interstitial cells (VICs). Rescue experiments of CRBBP were performed to confirm the influence of the miR-330-3p-CREBBP pathway in the calcification progress in porcine VICs. RNA sequencing indicated distinct expression of miR-330-3p in human BAV tissues compared with TAV, which was then confirmed by PCR. CREBBP expression levels in human BAV and TAV leaflets also demonstrated the opposite alterations. This negative correlation was then confirmed in cultured porcine VICs. Under an osteogenic environment, cellular calcification was promoted in miR-330-3p-overexpressed porcine VICs expressing higher bone morphogenetic protein 2, Runt-related transcription factor 2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and collagen I compared with controls. Rescue experiments further confirmed that miR-330-3p played its role via targeting CREBBP in porcine VICs. Collectively, miR-330-3p was upregulated in calcified BAV compared with TAV. The upregulation of miR-330-3p promotes the calcification progress partially via targeting CREBBP.",2020 Sep

Determining screening eligibility using individualised risk may improve screening effectiveness and reduce harm. Here, we compare the performance of two risk prediction models (PLCOM2012 and Liverpool Lung Project model (LLPv2)) and National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) eligibility criteria in a community-based screening programme. Methods: Ever-smokers aged 55–74, from deprived areas of Manchester, were invited to a Lung Health Check (LHC). Individuals at higher risk (PLCOM2012 score ≥1.51%) were offered annual LDCT screening over two rounds. LLPv2 score was calculated but not used for screening selection; ≥2.5% and ≥5% thresholds were used for analysis. Results: PLCOM2012 ≥1.51% selected 56% (n=1429) of LHC attendees for screening. LLPv2 ≥2.5% also selected 56% (n=1430) whereas NLST (47%, n=1188) and LLPv2 ≥5% (33%, n=826) selected fewer. Over two screening rounds 62 individuals were diagnosed with LC; representing 87% (n=62/71) of 6-year incidence predicted by mean PLCOM2012 score (5.0%). 26% (n=16/62) of individuals with LC were not eligible for screening using LLPv2 ≥5%, 18% (n=11/62) with NLST criteria and 7% (n=5/62) with LLPv2 ≥2.5%. NLST eligible Manchester attendees had 2.5 times the LC detection rate than NLST participants after two annual screens (≈4.3% (n=51/1188) vs 1.7% (n=438/26 309); p<0.0001). Adverse measures of health, including airflow obstruction, respiratory symptoms and cardiovascular disease, were positively correlated with LC risk. Coronary artery calcification was predictive of LC (adjOR 2.50, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.64; p=0.028). Conclusion: Prospective comparisons of risk prediction tools are required to optimise screening selection in different settings.

Considering the TNM (tumor, lymph node, metastasis) based classification for staging of breast cancer, it is essential to diagnose the disease at early stages. The present study aims to take advantage of the systems biology approach on genome wide gene expression profiling datasets to identify the potential biomarkers involved at stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV as well as in the integrated group. Three HER2-negative breast cancer microarray datasets were retrieved from the GEO database, including normal, stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV samples. Additionally, one dataset was also extracted to test the developed predictive models trained on the three datasets. The analysis of gene expression profiles to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed after preprocessing and normalization of data. Then, statistically significant prioritized DEGs were used to construct protein–protein interaction networks for the stages for module analysis and biomarker identification. Furthermore, the prioritized DEGs were used to determine the involved GO enrichment and KEGG signaling pathways at various stages of the breast cancer. The recurrence survival rate analysis of the identified gene biomarkers was conducted based on Kaplan–Meier methodology. Furthermore, the identified genes were validated not only by using several classification models but also through screening the experimental literature reports on the target genes. Fourteen (21 genes), nine (17 genes), eight (10 genes), four (7 genes), and six (8 genes) gene modules (total of 53 unique genes out of 63 genes with involving those with the same connectivity degree) were identified for stage I, stage II, stage III, stage IV, and the integrated group. Moreover, SMC4, FN1, FOS, JUN, and KIF11 and RACGAP1 genes with the highest connectivity degrees were in module 1 for abovementioned stages, respectively. The biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions were demonstrated for outcomes of GO analysis and KEGG pathway assessment. Additionally, the Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that 33 genes were found to be significant while considering the recurrence-free survival rate as an alternative to overall survival rate. Furthermore, the machine learning calcification models show good performance on the determined biomarkers. Moreover, the literature reports have confirmed all of the identified gene biomarkers for breast cancer. According to the literature evidence, the identified hub genes are highly correlated with HER2-negative breast cancer. The 53-mRNA signature might be a potential gene set for TNM based stages as well as possible therapeutics with potentially good performance in predicting and managing recurrence-free survival rates at stages I, II, III, and IV as well as in the integrated group. Moreover, the identified genes for the TNM-based stages can also be used as mRNA profile signatures to determine the current stage of the breast cancer.",2020

In this article, we briefly review different rodent models used to study vascular calcification in vivo, and critically assess the strengths and weaknesses of the current techniques used to analyze and quantify calcification in these models, namely 2-D histology and the o-cresolphthalein assay. In light of this, we examine X-ray micro-computed tomography (µCT) as an emerging complementary tool for the analysis of vascular calcification in animal models. We demonstrate that this non-destructive technique allows us to simultaneously quantify and localize calcification in an intact vessel in 3-D, and we consider recent advances in µCT sample preparation techniques. This review also discusses the potential to combine 3-D µCT analyses with subsequent 2-D histological, immunohistochemical, and proteomic approaches in correlative microscopy workflows to obtain rich, multifaceted information on calcification volume, calcification load, and signaling mechanisms from within the same arterial segment. In conclusion we briefly discuss the potential use of µCT to visualize and measure vascular calcification in vivo in real-time.",2020 Jun

One of the drawbacks in breast mammography is breast cancer masses are more difficult to be found in extremely dense breast tissue. We select 106 breast mammography images with masses from INbreast database. Through data augmentation, the number of breast mammography images was increased to 7632.

Correlation with Computed Tomography.,"Objective: Lymphatic irradiation in breast cancer improves locoregional control and has been shown to decrease distant metastasis. However, irradiation also accelerates the formation of atherosclerosis and can cause stenosis, not only in the coronary arteries but also in the internal mammary artery (IMA). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of radiation on IMAs via computed tomography (CT). Methods: We reviewed the data of 3,612 patients with breast cancer treated with radiotherapy (RT) between January 2010 and December 2016. We included 239 patients with appropriate imaging and nodal irradiation in the study. All patients were treated with lymphatic irradiation of 46–50 Gy, and a boost dose (6–10 Gy) to the involved internal mammary nodes (IMNs) when imaging studies demonstrated pathological enlargement. Bilateral IMA diameter and the presence of calcification were assessed via thin contrast-enhanced CT and those of ipsilateral irradiated IMAs were compared with those of contralateral nonirradiated IMAs. Results: The mean diameter of irradiated IMAs was significantly shorter than that of nonirradiated IMAs, regardless of laterality. All vascular calcifications were determined on the irradiated side. A boost dose of radiation to the IMNs and radiation technique did not significantly affect the IMA diameter or the presence of calcification. Conclusions: The diameter of the IMA is decreased due to RT regardless of laterality, radiation technique, and administration of a boost dose.

Electrochemiluminescence was used to measure the expression levels of CA153 and CEA, and chemical colorimetric assay for the measurement of TSGF expression. The differences in mass boundary, morphology, internal echo, calcification, peak blood flow velocity (Vmax), resistance index (RI), pulsatility index (PI) and blood flow signal classification between the two groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). The expression levels of CA153, CEA and TSGF in the serum of patients in the breast cancer group were significantly higher than those in the benign lesion group (P<0.01).

Central lymph node metastasis is common in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma and it is an important consideration in treatment strategy selection. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate clinicopathologic risk factors and thyroid nodule sonographic characteristics for central lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 599 papillary thyroid microcarcinoma patients who underwent surgery from 2005 to 2017 at a single institution. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the clinicopathologic factors and preoperative sonographic features of central lymph node metastasis. A receiver-operating characteristic, ROC curve analysis, was performed to identify the efficacy of ultrasonographic features in predicting central lymph node metastasis. A nomogram based on the risk factors was established to predict central lymph node metastasis. Results: The incidence of central lymph node metastasis was 22.4%. The univariate and multivariate analyses suggested that gender, age, multifocality, extrathyroidal invasion, and lateral lymph node metastasis were independent risk factors for central lymph node metastasis. The univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that nodular shape, margin, and calcification were independently associated with central lymph node metastasis. The ROC curve analysis revealed that the combination of shape, margin and calcification had excellent accuracy in predicting central lymph node metastasis. The nomogram was developed based on the identified risk factors for predicting central lymph node metastasis, and the calibration plot analysis indicated the good performance and clinical utility of the nomogram. Conclusions: Central lymph node metastasis is associated with male gender, younger age (<45 years), extrathyroidal invasion, multifocality and lateral lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma patients. The ultrasongraphic features, such as irregular shape, ill-defined margin and calcification, may improve the efficacy of predicting central lymph node metastasis. Surgeons and radiologists should pay close attention to the patients who have these risk factors. The nomogram may help guide surgical decision making in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.",2022 Jan-Feb
207,"Frank SM,Qi A,Ravasio D,Sasaki Y,Rosen EL,Watanabe T",Supervised learning occurs in visual perceptual learning of complex natural images.,"There have been long-standing debates regarding whether supervised or unsupervised learning mechanisms are involved in visual perceptual learning (VPL) [1–14]. However, these debates have been based on the effects of simple feedback only about response accuracy in detection or discrimination tasks of low-level visual features such as orientation [15–22]. Here, we examined whether the content of response feedback plays a critical role for the acquisition and long-term retention of VPL of complex natural images. We trained three groups of human subjects (n = 72 in total) to better detect “calcification” or “architectural distortion” lesions in mammograms either with no trial-by-trial feedback, partial trial-by-trial feedback (response correctness only) or detailed trial-by-trial feedback (response correctness and target location). Distortion lesions consist of more complex visual structures than calcification lesions [23–26]. We found that partial feedback is necessary for VPL of calcifications, whereas detailed feedback is required for VPL of distortions. Furthermore, detailed feedback during training is necessary for VPL of distortion lesions to be retained for six months. These results show that while supervised learning is heavily involved in VPL of complex natural images, the extent of supervision for VPL varies across different types of complex natural images. Such differential requirements for VPL to improve the detectability of lesions in mammograms are potentially informative to the professional training of radiologists.",2020 Aug 03

However, the value of miR-204 as the predictive biomarker for cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the association between the circulating miR-204 level and ten-year CVD risk based on the Framingham risk score (FRS). Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 194 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without CVD in Beijing Anzhen Hospital between January 2015 and September 2016. We used the FRS to evaluate the risk of CVD for each patient. Circulating miR-204 levels were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Circulating miR-204 levels were significantly lower in the group of patients (0.49 ± 0.13) at high risk of CVD (FRS > 20%) than in the low (FRS < 10%) and intermediate (FRS: 10%–20%) risk groups (0.87 ± 0.19 and 0.75 ± 0.25, respectively; P < 0.001). FRS was negatively correlated with miR-204 levels (r = –0.421, P < 0.001). According to multivariate logistic analyses, reduced miR-204 level was independently associated with an increased risk of CVD after adjusting for conventional risk factors (OR = 0.876, 95% CI: 0.807–0.950, P = 0.001). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the circulating miR-204 level can predict the high risk of CVD with higher specificity than the traditional risk factor of high systolic blood pressure or the protective factor of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that patients with lower circulating miR-204 levels were at high risk for CVD. After adjustment for potential confounders, miR-204 was independently associated with CVD in patients with T2DM.",2020 Jun

B-mode ultrasound is a well-validated research tool that has been translated increasingly into clinical practice. The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of carotid intima media thickness by B-mode ultrasonography in coronary artery disease patients. Material and methods: This was a case control study, including 100 cases and the same number of controls. Patients with positive angiographic findings and chest pain were considered as cases and those without as negative. Duplex carotid ultrasound was used to detect intima-media thickness (IMT). B-mode real-time ultrasonic images were obtained with a 7 MHz transducer. An intima media thickness of 0.6 mm was considered as being without plaque. Results: The angiographic findings were single-vessel disease, double-vessel disease, and triple-vessel disease in 18%, 11.5%, and 20.5% of cases, respectively, while there were no findings in controls. There was plaque formation in 14.5% and calcification in 12% of the cases. Sensitivity of B-mode ultrasonography was found to be 78%, specificity 75%, positive predictive value 75.72%, and negative predictive value 77.31%.

212,"Ou Lc,Zhong S,Ou Js,Tian Jw",Application of targeted therapy strategies with nanomedicine delivery for atherosclerosis.,"Atherosclerosis (AS) is the main pathological cause of coronary heart disease (CHD). Current clinical interventions including statin drugs can effectively reduce acute myocardial infarction and stroke to some extent, but residual risk remains high. The current clinical treatment regimens are relatively effective for early atherosclerotic plaques and can even reverse their progression. However, the effectiveness of these treatments for advanced AS is not ideal, and advanced atherosclerotic plaques—the pathological basis of residual risk—can still cause a recurrence of acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Recently, nanomedicine-based treatment strategies have been extensively used in antitumor therapy, and also shown great potential in anti-AS therapy. There are many microstructures in late-stage atherosclerotic plaques, such as neovascularization, micro-calcification, and cholesterol crystals, and these have become important foci for targeted nanomedicine delivery. The use of targeted nanoparticles has become an important strategy for the treatment of advanced AS to further reduce the residual risk of cardiovascular events. Furthermore, the feasibility and safety of nanotechnology in clinical treatment have been preliminarily confirmed. In this review, we summarize the application of nanomedicine delivery in the treatment of advanced AS and the clinical value of several promising nanodrugs.",2021 Jan
213,"Orzechowska S,Świsłocka R,Lewandowski W",Model of Pathological Collagen Mineralization Based on Spine Ligament Calcification.,"The aim of the study was to determine the time of mineral growth in human spine ligaments using a mathematical model. The study was based on our previous research in which the physicochemical analysis and computed microtomography measurements of deposits in ligamenta flava were performed. Hydroxyapatite-like mineral (HAP) constituted the mineral phase in ligament samples, in two samples calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate (CPPD) was confirmed. The micro-damage of collagen fibrils in the soft tissue is the crystallization center. The growth of the mineral nucleus is a result of the calcium ions deposition on the nucleus surface. Considering the calcium ions, the main component of HAP, it is possible to describe the grain growth using a diffusion model. The model calculations showed that the growth time of CPPD grains was ca. a month to 6 years, and for HAP grains >4 years for the young and >5.5 years for the elderly patients. The growth time of minerals with a radius >400 μm was relatively short and impossible to identify by medical imaging techniques. The change of growth rate was the largest for HAP deposits. The mineral growth time can provide valuable information for understanding the calcification mechanism, may be helpful in future experiments, as well as useful in estimating the time of calcification appearance.",2020 May
214,"Kwon DH,Ryu J,Kim YK,Kook H",Roles of Histone Acetylation Modifiers and Other Epigenetic Regulators in Vascular Calcification.,"Vascular calcification (VC) is characterized by calcium deposition inside arteries and is closely associated with the morbidity and mortality of atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). VC is now widely known to be an active process occurring in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) involving multiple mechanisms and factors. These mechanisms share features with the process of bone formation, since the phenotype switching from the contractile to the osteochondrogenic phenotype also occurs in VSMCs during VC. In addition, VC can be regulated by epigenetic factors, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNAs. Although VC is commonly observed in patients with chronic kidney disease and CVD, specific drugs for VC have not been developed. Thus, discovering novel therapeutic targets may be necessary. In this review, we summarize the current experimental evidence regarding the role of epigenetic regulators including histone deacetylases and propose the therapeutic implication of these regulators in the treatment of VC.",2020 May
215,"De Maré A,D’Haese PC,Verhulst A",The Role of Sclerostin in Bone and Ectopic Calcification.,"Sclerostin, a 22-kDa glycoprotein that is mainly secreted by the osteocytes, is a soluble inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling. Therefore, when present at increased concentrations, it leads to an increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. Serum sclerostin levels are known to be increased in the elderly and in patients with chronic kidney disease. In these patient populations, there is a high incidence of ectopic cardiovascular calcification. These calcifications are strongly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although data are still controversial, it is likely that there is a link between ectopic calcification and serum sclerostin levels. The main question, however, remains whether sclerostin exerts either a protective or deleterious role in the ectopic calcification process.",2020 May
216,"Li W,Zhang X,Xi X,Li Y,Quan H,Liu S,Wu L,Wu P,Lan W,Shao Y,Li H,Chen K,Hu Z",PLK2 modulation of enriched TAp73 affects osteogenic differentiation and prognosis in human osteosarcoma.,"There are three subtypes of undifferentiated human conventional osteosarcoma (HCOS): osteoblastic osteosarcoma (OOS), chondroblastic osteosarcoma (COS), and fibroblastic osteosarcoma (FOS). HCOS also exhibits heterogeneous pathological maldifferentiation in individual patients. Currently, the mechanism regulating HCOS differentiation remains unclear, and therapies are ineffective. Osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN) are markers of osteoblast maturation, and their expression is inhibited in HCOS. A previous study found that PLK2 inhibited TAp73 phosphorylation and consequent anti‐OS function of TAp73 in OS cells with enriched TAp73. TAp73 was also reported to regulate bone cell calcification. Here, OOS was found to have higher TAp73 levels and PLK2 expression than those in COS, which is correlated with HCOS maldifferentiation according to Spearman analysis and affects patient prognosis according to Kaplan‐Meier survival analysis. In the conventional OS cell‐line Saos2 and in patient‐derived xenograft OS (PDX‐OS) cells, increased PLK2 expression owing to abundant TAp73 levels affected OPN and OCN content as measured by RT‐PCR and Western blotting, and alizarin red staining showed that PLK2 affected calcium deposition in OS cells. In addition, PLK2 inhibition in PDX‐OS cells prohibited clone formation, as indicated by a clonogenic assay, and sensitized OS cells to cisplatin (CDDP) (which consequently limited proliferation), as shown by the CCK‐8 assay. In an established PDX animal model with abundant TAp73 levels, PLK2 inhibition or CDDP treatment prevented tumor growth and prolonged median survival. The combined therapeutic effect of PLK2 inhibition with CDDP treatment was better than that of either monotherapy. These results indicate that increased PLK2 levels due to enriched TAp73 affect osteogenic differentiation and maturation and OS prognosis. In conclusion, PLK2 is a potential target for differentiation therapy of OS with enriched TAp73.",2020 Jun
217,"Evenepoel P,Dejongh S,Verbeke K,Meijers B",The Role of Gut Dysbiosis in the Bone–Vascular Axis in Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of bone mineral density loss and vascular calcification. Bone demineralization and vascular mineralization often concur in CKD, similar to what observed in the general population. This contradictory association is commonly referred to as the ‘calcification paradox’ or the bone–vascular axis. Mounting evidence indicates that CKD-associated gut dysbiosis may be involved in the pathogenesis of the bone–vascular axis. A disrupted intestinal barrier function, a metabolic shift from a predominant saccharolytic to a proteolytic fermentation pattern, and a decreased generation of vitamin K may, alone or in concert, drive a vascular and skeletal pathobiology in CKD patients. A better understanding of the role of gut dysbiosis in the bone–vascular axis may open avenues for novel therapeutics, including nutriceuticals.",2020 May

In recent years, computed tomography has emerged as a non-invasive alternative to coronary angiography offering detection of coronary calcification and imaging of the vessel lumen by the use of iodinated contrast agents. Even though currently available invasive or non-invasive techniques can show the degree of vessel stenosis, they are unable to provide information about biofunctional plaque properties, e.g. plaque inflammation. Furthermore, the use of radiation and the necessity of iodinated contrast agents remain unfavourable prerequisites. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a radiation-free alternative to X-ray which offers anatomical and functional imaging contrasts fostering the idea of non-invasive biofunctional assessment of the coronary vessel wall. In combination with molecular contrast agents that target-specific epitopes of the vessel wall, MRI might reveal unique plaque properties rendering it, for example, ‘vulnerable and prone to rupture’. Early detection of these lesions may allow for early or prophylactic treatment even before an adverse coronary event occurs. Besides diagnostic imaging, advances in real-time image acquisition and motion compensation now provide grounds for MRI-guided coronary interventions. In this article, we summarize our research on MRI-based molecular imaging in cardiovascular disease and feature our advances towards real-time MRI-based coronary interventions in a porcine model.",2020 Apr

An in vivo OP rat model was constructed by performing the procedures of ovariectomy (OVX). Rats were randomly divided into sham group, OVX group and RLF+OVX group. BMSCs were extracted from healthy rats, and randomly divided into control group, TNF-α group, RLF group and TNF-α+RLF group. Viability and cellular calcification ability in each group were detected. The relative levels of osteocalcin (OCN), Runx2 and NF-κB in cells with different treatments were determined. The body weight of rats in the OVX group and RLF+OVX group gradually increased compared with that in the sham group on the 8th week. No significant difference in body weight was observed between the rats of the OVX group and RLF+OVX group. Bone metabolism index (BMD) in the rats of the RLF+OVX group was higher than that of the OVX group, and lower compared with that of the sham group. Compared with the sham group, the elastic/max radial degree and elastic/max load of femora were reduced in the OVX group and RLF+OVX group, especially in the OVX group. The relative levels of OCN and Runx2, as well as the ALP activity and calcification ability, were decreased in the OVX group compared with the sham group, and the effect was partially reversed by the RLF treatment. After osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, the viability and calcification ability were markedly reduced in TNF-α group, which was reversed by RLF treatment. Moreover, TNF-α induction downregulated the relative levels of OCN and Runx2, and RLF treatment could enhance their levels. The upregulated NF-κB protein level, induced by TNF-α, was reduced after RLF treatment. TNF-α induction inhibits osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, which could be remarkably alleviated by RLF. It is suggested that RLF contributes to the alleviation of OP progression.",2020 Jul
220,"Shin KS,Laohajaratsang M,Men S,Figueroa B,Dintzis SM,Fu D",Quantitative chemical imaging of breast calcifications in association with neoplastic processes.,"Calcifications play an essential role in early breast cancer detection and diagnosis. However, information regarding the chemical composition of calcifications identified on mammography and histology is limited. Detailed spectroscopy reveals an association between the chemical composition of calcifications and breast cancer, warranting the development of novel analytical tools to better define calcification types. Previous investigations average calcification composition across broad tissue sections with no spatially resolved information or provide qualitative visualization, which prevents a robust linking of specific spatially resolved changes in calcification chemistry with the pathologic process.Method: To visualize breast calcification chemical composition at high spatial resolution, we apply hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy to study breast calcifications associated with a spectrum of breast changes ranging from benign to neoplastic processes, including atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive ductal carcinoma. The carbonate content of individual breast calcifications is quantified using a simple ratiometric analysis.Results: Our findings reveal that intra-sample calcification carbonate content is closely associated with local pathological processes. Single calcification analysis supports previous studies demonstrating decreasing average carbonate level with increasing malignant potential. Sensitivity and specificity reach >85% when carbonate content level is used as the single differentiator in separating benign from neoplastic processes. However, the average carbonate content is limiting when trying to separate specific diagnostic categories, such as fibroadenoma and invasive ductal carcinoma. Second harmonic generation (SHG) data can provide critical information to bridge this gap.Conclusion: SRS, combined with SHG, can be a valuable tool in better understanding calcifications in carcinogenesis, diagnosis, and possible prognosis. This study not only reveals previously unknown large variations of breast microcalcifications in association with local malignancy but also corroborates the clinical value of linking microcalcification chemistry to breast malignancy. More importantly, it represents an important step in the development of a label-free imaging strategy for breast cancer diagnosis with tremendous potential to address major challenges in diagnostic discordance in pathology.",2020

Most patients with PEH are asymptomatic and the tumor occurs most frequently in women. Typical radiologic images of patients with PEH are multiple irregular nodules with punctate calcification and pleural indentation. Here, we describe a 54-year-old woman who presented with multiple bilateral nodules of different sizes and well-defined borders, as well as lung markings, without punctate calcification or pleural indentation. These atypical computed tomography images resulted in misdiagnosis as metastatic lung cancer. Right upper lobe wedge resection was performed; intraoperative frozen pathologic examination suggested that the tumor was benign. However, immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of PEH. Subsequently, the patient chose watchful waiting, rather than chemotherapy. This rare case of PEH with atypical computed tomography findings, which was misdiagnosed as metastatic lung cancer, demonstrates that intraoperative frozen analysis is unreliable; thus, histopathological analysis is necessary.",2020 Apr

However, the biological function of MGP inside cancer cells and its role in colon cancer (CC) remain largely unknown. MGP expression and its association with clinicopathologic characteristics in CC were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and verified by Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. The effects of MGP on CC cell proliferation were evaluated via knockdown and overexpression experiments in vitro. Mechanisms of MGP in CC were explored by western blots, quantitative real-time PCR, Fluo-3 AM staining, Rhod-2 AM staining, immunofluorescence, and other techniques. Our study confirmed that MGP was upregulated in different stages of CC and associated with a worse prognosis. MGP could enrich intracellular free Ca2+ concentration and promote nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/p65 phosphorylation, activating the expression of c-MYC, ICAM-1, and VEGFA. Furthermore, the reduction of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration and the subsequent growth inhibition effect on CC cells induced by small interfering RNA targeting MGP (siMGP) could be rescued by a higher calcium concentration environment. Therefore, MGP promotes the growth and proliferation of CC cells by enriching intracellular calcium concentration and activating the NF-κB pathway, and it could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in CC patients.",2020 Jun 26

224,"Lee SJ,Lee IK,Jeon JH",Vascular Calcification—New Insights into Its Mechanism.,"Vascular calcification (VC), which is categorized by intimal and medial calcification, depending on the site(s) involved within the vessel, is closely related to cardiovascular disease. Specifically, medial calcification is prevalent in certain medical situations, including chronic kidney disease and diabetes. The past few decades have seen extensive research into VC, revealing that the mechanism of VC is not merely a consequence of a high-phosphorous and -calcium milieu, but also occurs via delicate and well-organized biologic processes, including an imbalance between osteochondrogenic signaling and anticalcific events. In addition to traditionally established osteogenic signaling, dysfunctional calcium homeostasis is prerequisite in the development of VC. Moreover, loss of defensive mechanisms, by microorganelle dysfunction, including hyper-fragmented mitochondria, mitochondrial oxidative stress, defective autophagy or mitophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, may all contribute to VC. To facilitate the understanding of vascular calcification, across any number of bioscientific disciplines, we provide this review of a detailed updated molecular mechanism of VC. This encompasses a vascular smooth muscle phenotypic of osteogenic differentiation, and multiple signaling pathways of VC induction, including the roles of inflammation and cellular microorganelle genesis.",2020 Apr

Methods: Patients with neoplasms with MDP uptake were retrospectively identified. Based on histopathology, tumors were categorized as epithelial malignant tumors, mesenchymal tumors, blastomas and germ cell tumors. The degree of radioactivity accumulation in lesions relative to the uptake in ribs and sternum or spine was classified as “+”, “++” and “+++”. The results were compared between children and adults. The correlations between MDP uptake in soft tumors and tumor differentiation and pathology were investigated. Results: Extraosseous soft tissue tumors that accumulated MDP were found in 33 children and 31 adults. In children, neuroblastoma was the most common extraosseous soft tissue tumor that accumulated MDP; in adults, MDP uptake was mostly found in lung cancer. MDP uptake in pediatric soft tissue tumors was higher than that in adults. MDP uptake in extraosseous soft tissue tumors with different histopathologic classifications was significantly different among 64 patients. In 41 patients with available tumor differentiation data from histopathology, MDP uptake in low or poorly differentiated soft tumors was higher than that in the moderately or well-differentiated lesions. Necrosis and/or calcifications were showed in most of pediatric and adult neoplasms. Conclusion: Significant elevations in MDP uptake in extraosseous soft tissue tumors are associated with poorly differentiated tumors in both children and adults. The mechanism of bone tracer uptake in pediatric and adult neoplasms was mostly related to necrosis and/or necrosis and calcification. The extraosseous soft tissue tumors with MDP uptake in pediatric patients were different from those in adults. In addition, consistent with the inherent degree of tumor malignancy, MDP uptake in children was higher than that in adults.",2020

SMC-specific ablation of TGFβ signaling in Apoe−/− mice on a hypercholesterolemic diet led to development of aortic aneurysms exhibiting all the features of human disease, which was associated with transdifferentiation of a subset of contractile SMCs into an MSC-like intermediate state that generated osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and macrophages.

This paper aims to addresses the challenges regarding decision-making based on mammography reports and propose a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) using data mining methods to help clinicians to interpret mammography reports. Methods: For this purpose, 2441 mammography reports were collected from Imam Khomeini Hospital from March 21, 2018, to March 20, 2019. In the first step, these mammography reports are analyzed and program code is developed to transform the reports into a dataset. Then, the weight of every feature of the dataset is calculated. Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Deep Learning classifiers are applied to the dataset to build a model capable of predicting the need for referral to biopsy. Afterward, the models are evaluated using cross-validation with measuring Area Under Curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity indices. Results: The mammography type (diagnostic or screening), mass and calcification features mentioned in the reports are the most important features for decision-making. Results reveal that the K-NN model is the most accurate and specific classifier with the accuracy and specificity values of 84.06% and 84.72% respectively. The Random Forest classifier has the best sensitivity and AUC with the sensitivity and AUC values of 87.74% and 0.905 respectively. Conclusions: Accordingly, data mining approaches are proved to be a helpful tool to make the final decision as to whether patients should be referred to biopsy or not based on mammography reports.

Initial presentation was for a recurrent, locally invasive intranasal tumor without definite diagnosis. Further clinical developments during follow up, central precocious puberty and testicular tumor with calcification, led to the diagnosis of LCCSCT, a CNC-related tumor. Histopathologic examination of the intranasal tumor was re-evaluated with this knowledge and OMX was diagnosed. Coexistence of OMX and LCCSCT suggested CNC. Genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous non-sense p.Trp 224* (c.672G>A) in the PRKAR1A gene.

The visual estimation of CAC from CTAC scans performed for PET/CT is comparable to the standard CAC score scan. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with single-photon emission CT (SPECT) is commonly performed for risk stratification before oncologic surgery. Objective:: We investigated the value of visual estimation of CAC from CTAC of PET/CT as well as other factors such as coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors and type of cancer as predictors of MPI ischemia. Methods:: Retrospectively, we identified 268 patients who underwent PET/CT and MPI for preoperative cardiac evaluation. Visual estimation of CAC was performed and classified into four categories. Results:: The results of visual CAC were as follows: 47.8% – zero CAC, 32.8% – mild CAC, 14.2% – moderate CAC, and 5.2% – severe CAC. The majority of patients (85.8%) had normal MPI, whereas 14.2% were abnormal. There was a strong association between ischemia on MPI and CAC seen on CTAC (P < 0.01), dyslipidemia (P < 0.01), family history of CAD (P < 0.05), smoking (P < 0.01), and type of malignancy (P < 0.01). Conclusion:: A strong association exists between visual estimation of CAC on CTAC and MPI. Zero is highly associated with normal MPI, but moderate-to-severe CAC is associated with abnormal MPI, in addition smoking, dyslipidemia, and certain cancer are associated with ischemic MPI; subsequently, preoperative cardiac testing is warranted in these subsets of patients.",2020 Apr-Jun

Methods: This retrospective study included 92 consecutive patients with 95 thyroid nodules examined on B-mode US and SWE before US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy or surgical excision. B-mode US findings (composition, echogenicity, margin, shape, and calcification) and SWE elasticity parameters (maximum [Emax], mean, minimum, and nodule-to-normal parenchymal ratio of elasticity) were reviewed and compared between benign and malignant thyroid nodules. The diagnostic performance of B-mode US and SWE for predicting malignant thyroid nodules was analyzed. The optimal cutoff values of elasticity parameters for identifying malignancy were determined. Diagnostic performance was compared between B-mode US only, SWE only, and the combination of B-mode US with SWE. Results: On multivariate logistic regression analysis, age (odds ratio [OR], 0.90; P=0.028), a taller-than-wide shape (OR, 11.3; P=0.040), the presence of calcifications (OR, 15.0; P=0.021), and Emax (OR, 1.22; P=0.021) were independent predictors of malignancy in thyroid nodules. The combined use of B-mode US findings and SWE yielded improvements in sensitivity, the positive predictive value, the negative predictive value, and accuracy compared with the use of B-mode US findings only, but with no statistical significance.

Objectives: To determine the benefits and harms of shock wave therapy for rotator cuff disease, with or without calcification, and to establish its usefulness in the context of other available treatment options. Search methods: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP up to November 2019, with no restrictions on language. We reviewed the reference lists of retrieved trials to identify potentially relevant trials. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that used quasi‐randomised methods to allocate participants, investigating participants with rotator cuff disease with or without calcific deposits. We included trials of comparisons of extracorporeal or radial shock wave therapy versus any other intervention. Major outcomes were pain relief greater than 30%, mean pain score, function, patient‐reported global assessment of treatment success, quality of life, number of participants experiencing adverse events and number of withdrawals due to adverse events. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. The primary comparison was shock wave therapy compared to placebo. Main results: Thirty‐two trials (2281 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Most trials (25) included participants with rotator cuff disease and calcific deposits, five trials included participants with rotator cuff disease and no calcific deposits, and two trials included a mixed population of participants with and without calcific deposits.Twelve trials compared shock wave therapy to placebo, 11 trials compared high‐dose shock wave therapy (0.2 mJ/mm² to 0.4 mJ/mm² and above) to low‐dose shock wave therapy. Single trials compared shock wave therapy to ultrasound‐guided glucocorticoid needling, ultrasound‐guided hyaluronic acid injection, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS), no treatment or exercise; dual session shock wave therapy to single session therapy; and different delivery methods of shock wave therapy. Our main comparison was shock wave therapy versus placebo and results are reported for the 3 month follow up.All trials were susceptible to bias; including selection (74%), performance (62%), detection (62%), and selective reporting (45%) biases.No trial measured participant‐reported pain relief of 30%. However, in one trial (74 participants), at 3 months follow up, 14/34 participants reported pain relief of 50% or greater with shock wave therapy compared with 15/40 with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.94); low‐quality evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). Mean pain (0 to 10 scale, higher scores indicate more pain) was 3.02 points in the placebo group and 0.78 points better (0.17 better to 1.4 better; clinically important change was 1.5 points) with shock wave therapy (9 trials, 608 participants), moderate‐quality evidence (downgraded for bias). Mean function (scale 0 to 100, higher scores indicate better function) was 66 points with placebo and 7.9 points better (1.6 better to 14 better, clinically important difference 10 points) with shock wave therapy (9 trials, 612 participants), moderate‐quality evidence (downgraded for bias). Participant‐reported success was reported by 58/150 people in shock wave therapy group compared with 35/137 people in placebo group (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.91; 6 trials, 287 participants), low‐quality evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). None of the trials measured quality of life.Withdrawal rate or adverse event rates may not differ between extracorporeal shock wave therapy and placebo, but we are uncertain due to the small number of events. There were 11/34 withdrawals in the extracorporeal shock wave therapy group compared with 13/40 withdrawals in the placebo group (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.31; 7 trials, 581 participants) low‐quality evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision); and 41/156 adverse events with extracorporeal shock wave therapy compared with 10/139 adverse events in the placebo group (RR 3.61, 95% CI 2.00 to 6.52; 5 trials, 295 participants) low‐quality evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision).Subgroup analyses indicated that there were no between‐group differences in pain and function outcomes in participants who did or did not have calcific deposits in the rotator cuff. Authors' conclusions: Based upon the currently available low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence, there were very few clinically important benefits of shock wave therapy, and uncertainty regarding its safety. Wide clinical diversity and varying treatment protocols means that we do not know whether or not some trials tested subtherapeutic doses, possibly underestimating any potential benefits.Further trials of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for rotator cuff disease should be based upon a strong rationale and consideration of whether or not they would alter the conclusions of this review. A standard dose and treatment protocol should be decided upon before further research is conducted. Development of a core set of outcomes for trials of rotator cuff disease and other shoulder disorders would also facilitate our ability to synthesise the evidence.",2020
234,"Li W,Zhang L,Li W,Zhang R",The Value of 99mTc-Methylene Diphosphonate Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography/Computed Tomography in Detecting Atraumatic Costal Cartilage Fracture in Malignant Tumor Patients.,"Objectives: To assess the clinical significance and single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) features of atraumatic costal cartilage fracture (CCF) in patients with malignant tumors.Methods: This was a retrospective review of 38 tumor patients with atraumatic CCF referred to SPECT/CT, who were served as the study group (SG). The features of SPECT/CT of atraumatic CCF were assessed. Another 100 tumor patients who underwent chest SPECT/CT and did not have CCF were randomly selected as the control group (CG). In all patients (SG + CG), the diagnostic powers in the detection of atraumatic CCF were computed among CT, SPECT, and SPECT/CT. The final diagnosis was based on pathological findings and radiologic follow-up of at least 1 year.Results: On SPECT/CT images of atraumatic CCF in the SG, fracture lines, irregular calcification, deformation, and swelling were, respectively, noted in 26.3, 47.4, 34.2, and 18.4% of lesions; low, moderate, and high uptake were, respectively, noted in 13.2, 52.6, and 34.2% of lesions. In all patients (SG + CG), the diagnostic powers in the detection of atraumatic CCF of CT, SPECT, and SPECT/CT were as follows: sensitivity 63.2, 100.0, and 92.1%; specificity 86.0, 81.0, and 94.0%; negative predictive value 86.0, 100.0, and 96.9%; positive predictive value 63.1, 66.7, and 85.4%; and area under the curve value 0.746, 0.905, and 0.931.Conclusions: Atraumatic CCF has certain characteristic appearances on SPECT/CT. It should be enrolled in the differential diagnoses when costal cartilages of patients with malignant tumors show abnormal elevated 99mTc-MDP uptake on scintigraphy. Single-photon emission computed tomography/CT has excellent diagnostic power in detecting atraumatic CCF.",2020

Lung cancer patients receive considerable doses of TIR, making them a high-risk population that may benefit from post-therapy surveillance. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a known biomarker of CAD development and may serve as a useful indicator of disease progression in this population. We hypothesized greater CAC progression in lung cancer patients subjected to higher whole heart radiation doses. Methods: CAC progression (pre- and >2 years post-TIR) from chest CT scans of lung cancer patients were evaluated. A 2:1 matched control population was established controlling for age, gender, race, and CT scan interval. Vessel-specific CAC presence, progression, and extension in pre- and post-interval CT studies was evaluated by two blinded reviewers using the ordinal method. Dosimetric treatment files were restored and contours of the whole heart and proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) were created within existing plans to compute radiation doses (Pinnacle Treatment Planning Software). Binary logistic regression analysis identified factors predictive for CAC development. Multiple logistic regression analysis with hierarchal method was used to assess covariates. Results: Thirty-five patients and 65 controls (50% female) were evaluated; mean age 57 years, mean follow-up post-radiation 4.9±2.2 years. Average mean and maximum left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) radiation doses were 19.9 Gy (95% CI, 14.1–25.7) and 30.7 Gy (95% CI, 23.8–37.5), respectively; 91.6% inter-observer variability. There was greater incidence of coronary calcification in irradiated patients (48.6% vs. 24.6%; P=0.01). In interval CT scans, a greater proportion of radiated patients demonstrated new coronary calcification (P=0.007) and extension within the LAD (P=0.003). Radiation exposure was the only independent predictor of new calcification (OR 3.1; 95% CI: 1.09–9.2). Conclusions: We identified both an increase in the development and progression of CAC in lung cancer patients receiving TIR. Future studies utilizing alternative cancer populations and larger sample sizes are necessary to further correlate radiographic and dosimetric observations to cardiovascular events.",2020 Mar 2020 Mar
236,"Ohno K,Okada T,Nakamura T,Koyama H",Sebaceous carcinoma of the breast predominantly characterized by intraductal growth: a case report.,"Background: Sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is frequently classified as periocular or extraocular. Extraocular SC is rare and mainly occurs in the head and neck, the major salivary glands, or oral mucosa. SC of the breast, lung, and ovary is particularly rare, and the few cases of SC of the breast predominantly exhibit intraductal growth. Case presentation: A 47-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital with accumulated polymorphic calcification in the left breast which was detected using mammography. Ultrasonography revealed an irregular 13-mm mass in the left breast, and analysis of a core needle biopsy revealed noninvasive ductal carcinoma. Total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. Histopathology demonstrated that carcinoma in situ (CIS) represented a significant lesion, and the cytoplasm of tumor cells was clear with numerous minute vacuoles. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that most tumor cells expressed adipophilin. Together, these findings led to a diagnosis of SC, mainly comprising CIS. Conclusions: We encountered a rare case of SC of the breast with predominant CIS.",2020 Dec
237,"Shioi A,Morioka T,Shoji T,Emoto M",The Inhibitory Roles of Vitamin K in Progression of Vascular Calcification.,"Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that is indispensable for the activation of vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs) and may be implicated in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Vascular calcification is intimately associated with CV events and mortality and is a chronic inflammatory process in which activated macrophages promote osteoblastic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and oncostatin M (OSM) in both intimal and medial layers of arterial walls. This process may be mainly mediated through NF-κB signaling pathway. Vitamin K has been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory effects through antagonizing NF-κB signaling in both in vitro and in vivo studies, suggesting that vitamin K may prevent vascular calcification via anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a major inhibitor of soft tissue calcification and contributes to preventing both intimal and medial vascular calcification. Vitamin K may also inhibit progression of vascular calcification by enhancing the activity of MGP through facilitating its γ-carboxylation. In support of this hypothesis, the procalcific effects of warfarin, an antagonist of vitamin K, on arterial calcification have been demonstrated in several clinical studies. Among the inactive MGP forms, dephospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) may be regarded as the most useful biomarker of not only vitamin K deficiency, but also vascular calcification and CVD. There have been several studies showing the association of circulating levels of dp-ucMGP with vitamin K intake, vascular calcification, mortality, and CVD. However, additional larger prospective studies including randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm the beneficial effects of vitamin K supplementation on CV health.",2020 Feb

The mutant mouse strain D2,Ahsg-/- combines fetuin-A deficiency with the calcification-prone DBA/2 genetic background, having a particularly severe compound phenotype of microvascular and soft tissue calcification. Here we studied mechanisms leading to soft tissue calcification, organ damage and death in these mice. We analyzed mice longitudinally by echocardiography, X-ray-computed tomography, analytical electron microscopy, histology, mass spectrometry proteomics, and genome-wide microarray-based expression analyses of D2 wildtype and Ahsg-/- mice. Fetuin-A-deficient mice had calcified lesions in myocardium, lung, brown adipose tissue, reproductive organs, spleen, pancreas, kidney and the skin, associated with reduced growth, cardiac output and premature death. Importantly, early-stage calcified lesions presented in the lumen of the microvasculature suggesting precipitation of mineral containing complexes from the fluid phase of blood. Genome-wide expression analysis of calcified lesions and surrounding (not calcified) tissue, together with morphological observations, indicated that the calcification was not associated with osteochondrogenic cell differentiation, but rather with thrombosis and fibrosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that soft tissue calcification can start by intravascular mineral deposition causing microvasculopathy, which impacts on growth, organ function and survival. Our study underscores the importance of fetuin-A and related systemic regulators of calcified matrix metabolism to prevent cardiovascular disease, especially in dysregulated mineral homeostasis.",2020

This retrospective observational cohort study analysed asymptomatic women from the BBC registry. In 126 consecutive women (age, 54.5 ± 7.0 years) who underwent BAC evaluation and repeated coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) examinations, the coronary arterial calcification score (CACS) and segment stenosis score (SSS) were evaluated to assess the progression of coronary arterial calcification (CAC) and coronary atherosclerotic plaque (CAP). CAC and CAP progression were observed in 42 (33.3%) and 26 (20.6%) women, respectively (median interscan time, 4.3 years), and were associated with the presence of BAC and a higher BAC score at baseline. Women with BAC demonstrated higher CAC and CAP progression rates and showed higher chances for CAC and CAP progression during follow-up (p < 0.001 for both). In multivariable analyses, the BAC score remained independently associated with both CAC and CAP progression rates after adjustment for clinical risk factors (β = 0.087, p = 0.029; and β = 0.020, p = 0.010, respectively) and with additional adjustment for baseline CACS (β = 0.080, p = 0.040; and β = 0.019, p = 0.012, respectively) or SSS (β = 0.079, p = 0.034; and β = 0.019, p = 0.011, respectively). Thus, BAC may be related to the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and its evaluation may facilitate decision-making.",2020

Processing was done on innate A-line units with labels fibrolipidic (fibrous tissue followed by lipidous tissue), fibrocalcific (fibrous tissue followed by calcification), or other. We trained/tested on an expansive data set (6,556 images), and performed an active learning, relabeling step to improve noisy ground truth labels. Conditional random field was an important post-processing step to reduce classification errors. Sensitivities/specificities were 84.8%/97.8% and 91.4%/95.7% for fibrolipidic and fibrocalcific plaques, respectively. Over lesions, en face classification maps showed automated results that agreed favorably to manually labeled counterparts. Adding lumen morphological features gave statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05), as compared to classification with convolutional features alone. Automated assessments of clinically relevant plaque attributes (arc angle and length), compared favorably to those from manual labels. Our hybrid approach gave statistically improved results as compared to previous A-line classification methods using deep learning or hand-crafted features alone. This plaque characterization approach is fully automated, robust, and promising for live-time treatment planning and research applications.",2020

Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a DL method for automatic calcium scoring across a wide range of CT examination types and to investigate whether the method can adapt to different types of CT examinations when representative images are added to the existing training data set. Materials and Methods: The study included 7240 participants who underwent various types of nonenhanced CT examinations that included the heart: coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring CT, diagnostic CT of the chest, PET attenuation correction CT, radiation therapy treatment planning CT, CAC screening CT, and low-dose CT of the chest. CAC and thoracic aorta calcification (TAC) were quantified using a convolutional neural network trained with (a) 1181 low-dose chest CT examinations (baseline), (b) a small set of examinations of the respective type supplemented to the baseline (data specific), and (c) a combination of examinations of all available types (combined). Supplemental training sets contained 199–568 CT images depending on the calcium burden of each population. The DL algorithm performance was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between DL and manual (Agatston) CAC and (volume) TAC scoring and with linearly weighted κ values for cardiovascular risk categories (Agatston score; cardiovascular disease risk categories: 0, 1–10, 11–100, 101–400, >400). Results: At baseline, the DL algorithm yielded ICCs of 0.79–0.97 for CAC and 0.66–0.98 for TAC across the range of different types of CT examinations. ICCs improved to 0.84–0.99 (CAC) and 0.92–0.99 (TAC) for CT protocol–specific training and to 0.85–0.99 (CAC) and 0.96–0.99 (TAC) for combined training. For assignment of cardiovascular disease risk category, the κ value for all test CT scans was 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89, 0.91) for the baseline training. It increased to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.93) for both data-specific and combined training. Conclusion: A deep learning calcium scoring algorithm for quantification of coronary and thoracic calcium was robust, despite substantial differences in CT protocol and variations in subject population. Augmenting the algorithm training with CT protocol–specific images further improved algorithm performance.© RSNA, 2020See also the editorial by Vannier in this issue.",2020 Apr
242,"Lago MA,Sechopoulos I,Bochud FO,Eckstein MP",Measurement of the useful field of view for single slices of different imaging modalities and targets.,"Purpose: With three-dimensional (3-D) images displayed as stacks of 2-D images, radiologists rely more heavily on vision away from their fixation point to visually process information, guide eye movements, and detect abnormalities. Thus the ability to detect targets away from the fixation point, commonly characterized as the useful field of view (UFOV), becomes critical for these 3-D imaging modalities. We investigate how the UFOV, defined as the eccentricity, in which detection performance degrades to a given probability, varies across imaging modalities and targets.Approach: We measure the detectability of different targets at various distances from gaze locations for single slices of liver computed tomography (CT), 2-D digital mammograms (DM), and single slices of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) cases. Observers with varying expertise were instructed to maintain their gaze at a point while a short display of the image was flashed and an eye tracker verified observer’s steady fixation. Display times were 200 and 1000 ms for CT images and 500 ms for DM and DBT images.Results: We find variations in the UFOV from 9 to 12 deg for liver CT to as small as 2.5 to 5 deg for calcification clusters in breast images (DM and DBT). We compare our results to those reported in the literature for lung nodules and discuss the differences across methods used to measure the UFOV, their dependence on case selection/task difficulty, viewing conditions, and observer expertise. We propose a complementary measure defined in terms of performance degradation relative to the peak foveal performance (relative-UFOV) to circumvent UFOV’s variations with case selection/task difficulty.Conclusion: Our results highlight the variations in the UFOV across imaging modalities, target types, observer expertise, and measurement methods and suggest an additional relative-UFOV measure to more thoroughly characterize the detection performance away from point of fixation.",2020 Mar

The present approach was intended to address the potency of nanohydroxyapatite (nHA), chitosan/hydroxyapatite nanocomposites (nCh/HA) and silver/hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (nAg/HA) to modulate bone turnover deviation in primary osteoporosis induced in the experimental model. Characterisation techniques such as TEM, zeta-potential, FT-IR and XRD were used to assess the morphology, the physical as well as the chemical features of the prepared nanostructures. The in vivo experiment was conducted on forty-eight adult female rats, randomised into 6 groups (8 rats/group), (1) gonad-intact, (2) osteoporotic group, (3) osteoporotic + nHA, (4) osteoporotic + nCh/HA, (5) osteoporotic + nAg/HA and (6) osteoporotic + alendronate (ALN). After three months of treatment, serum sclerostin (SOST), bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and bone sialoprotein (BSP) levels were quantified using ELISA. Femur bone receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) and cathepsin K (CtsK) mRNA levels were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. Moreover, alizarin red S staining was applied to determine the mineralisation intensity of femur bone. Findings in the present study indicated that treatment with nHA, nCh/HA or nAg/HA leads to significant repression of serum SOST, BALP and BSP levels parallel to a significant down-regulation of RANKL and CtsK gene expression levels. On the other side, significant enhancement in the calcification intensity of femur bone has been noticed. The outcomes of this experimental setting ascertained the potentiality of nHA, nCh/HA and nAg/HA as promising nanomaterials in attenuating the excessive bone turnover in the primary osteoporotic rat model. The mechanisms behind the efficacy of the investigated nanostructures involved the obstacle of serum and tissue indices of bone resorption besides the strengthening of bone mineralisation.",2020 Feb

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or “statins” reduce cardiovascular events. Invasive clinical studies have found that statins alter both the lipid and calcium composition of plaque, but the molecular mechanisms of statin-mediated effects on plaque calcium composition remain unclear. We recently defined a macrophage Rac-IL-1β signaling axis to be a key mechanism in promoting atherosclerotic calcification and sought to define the impact of statin therapy on this pathway. Approach and Results:: Here, we demonstrate that statin therapy is independently associated with elevated coronary calcification in a high-risk patient population and that statins disrupt the complex between Rac1 and its inhibitor, RhoGDI, leading to increased active (GTP-bound) Rac1 in primary monocytes/macrophages. Rac1 activation is prevented by rescue with the isoprenyl precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Statin treated macrophages exhibit increased activation of NF-κB, increased IL-1β mRNA, and increased Rac1-dependent IL-1β protein secretion in response to inflammasome stimulation. Using an animal model of calcific atherosclerosis, inclusion of statin in the atherogenic diet led to a myeloid Rac1-dependent increase in atherosclerotic calcification, which was associated with increased serum IL-1β expression, increased plaque Rac1-activation, and increased plaque expression of the osteogenic markers, ALP and RUNX2. Conclusion:: Statins are capable of increasing atherosclerotic calcification through disinhibition of a macrophage Rac1-IL-1β signaling axis.",2020 Mar

Materials and Methods:: Mammographically detected calcifications that were initially diagnosed as DCIS on core biopsy and underwent definitive surgical excision between 2010 and 2015 were identified. Thirty cases of suspicious calcifications upstaged to invasive ductal carcinoma and 120 cases of DCIS confirmed at the time of definitive surgery were randomly selected. Nuclear grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, patient age, calcification long axis length, and breast density were collected. Ten breast radiologists who were blinded to all clinical and pathology data independently reviewed all cases and estimated the likelihood that the DCIS would be upstaged to invasive disease at surgical excision. Subgroup analysis was performed based on nuclear grade, long axis length, breast density and after exclusion of microinvasive disease. Results:: Reader performance to predict upstaging ranged from an AUC of 0.541 to 0.684 with a mean AUC of 0.620 (95% CI: 0.489–0.751). Performances improved for lesions smaller than 2 cm (AUC: 0.676 vs 0.500; p = 0.002). The exclusion of micro-invasive cases also improved performance (AUC: 0.651 vs 0.620; p = 0.005).

249,"Opdebeeck B,D’Haese PC,Verhulst A",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms that Induce Arterial Calcification by Indoxyl Sulfate and P-Cresyl Sulfate.,"The protein-bound uremic toxins, indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), are considered to be harmful vascular toxins. Arterial media calcification, or the deposition of calcium phosphate crystals in the arteries, contributes significantly to cardiovascular complications, including left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension, and impaired coronary perfusion in the elderly and patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes. Recently, we reported that both IS and PCS trigger moderate to severe calcification in the aorta and peripheral vessels of CKD rats. This review describes the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which these uremic toxins induce arterial media calcification. A complex interplay between inflammation, coagulation, and lipid metabolism pathways, influenced by epigenetic factors, is crucial in IS/PCS-induced arterial media calcification. High levels of glucose are linked to these events, suggesting that a good balance between glucose and lipid levels might be important. On the cellular level, effects on endothelial cells, which act as the primary sensors of circulating pathological triggers, might be as important as those on vascular smooth muscle cells. Endothelial dysfunction, provoked by IS and PCS triggered oxidative stress, may be considered a key event in the onset and development of arterial media calcification. In this review a number of important outstanding questions such as the role of miRNA’s, phenotypic switching of both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells and new types of programmed cell death in arterial media calcification related to protein-bound uremic toxins are put forward and discussed.",2020 Jan

251,"Chen S,Wang J,Cai C,Xie X",N-myc Downstream-Regulated Gene 2 (NDRG2) Promotes Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (BMP2)-Induced Osteoblastic Differentiation and Calcification by Janus Kinase 3 (JAK3)/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) Signaling Pathway.,"Background: Osteoporosis is an osteolytic disease resulted from imbalance in bone homeostasis. Studies indicated that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) could affect the osteoclast differentiation. However, the effect of NDRG2 on osteoblastic differentiation and calcification remains unknown. Hence, we aimed to analyze the effect of NDRG2 on the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts. Material/Methods: The differentiation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) induced MC3T3-E1 cells was observed by the microscope. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis detected the expression of BMP2, NDRG2, runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osteoprotegerin (OPG), osterix (OSX), and osteocalcin (OCN). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay was detecting the ALP activity and alizarin red staining assay was analyzing intracellular calcium salt deposition. The cell transfection was also verified by RT-qPCR analysis. Results: The results demonstrated that BMP2 promoted the osteoblastic differentiation with the increasing expression of Runx2, OPG, OSX, and OCN. NDRG2 expression was upregulated during osteogenic differentiation. NDRG2 overexpression promoted the expression of Runx2, OPG, OSX, and OCN, and increased the ALP activity while NDRG2 inhibition reversed the changes. NDRG2 overexpression increased the intracellular calcium salt deposition and NDRG2 inhibition reversed the changes. The role of NDRG2 in osteoblastic differentiation and calcification was played through the JAK3/STAT3 signal pathway. Conclusions: The presented data indicated that NDRG2 promoted BMP2-induced osteoblastic differentiation and calcification by activating the JAK3/STAT3 signal pathway.",2020
252,"Gee T,Farrar E,Wang Y,Wu B,Hsu K,Zhou B,Butcher J",NFκB Activity Regulates Cell Type and Context Specific Susceptibility to Calcification in the Aortic Valve.,"Objective:: While often studied independently, little is known how aortic valve endothelial cells (VEC) and valve interstitial cells (VIC) interact collaborate to maintain tissue homeostasis or drive valve calcific pathogenesis. Inflammatory signaling is a recognized initiator of valve calcification, but the cell-type specific downstream mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this study, we test how inflammatory signaling via NFκB activity coordinates unique and shared mechanisms of VEC and VIC differentiation during calcific progression. Approach and Results:: Activated NFκB was present throughout the CAVD process in both endothelial and interstitial cell populations in an established mouse model of hypercholesterolemia-induced CAVD and in human CAVD. NFκB activity induces EndMT in 3D cultured aortic VEC and subsequent osteogenic calcification of transformed cells. Similarly, 3D cultured VIC calcified via NFκB mediated osteogenic differentiation. NFκB mediated EndMT was directly demonstrated in vivo during CAVD via genetic lineage tracking. Genetic deletion of NFκB in either whole valves or valve endothelium only was sufficient to prevent valve specific molecular and cellular mechanisms of CAVD in vivo despite the persistence of a CAVD inducing environment. Conclusion:: Our results identify NFκB signaling as an essential molecular regulator for both valve endothelial and interstitial participation in CAVD pathogenesis. Direct demonstration of VEC EndMT transmigration in vivo during CAVD highlights a new cellular population for further investigation in CAVD morbidity. The efficacy of valve-specific NFκB modulation in inhibiting hypercholesterolemic CAVD suggests potential benefits of multi-cell type integrated investigation for biological therapeutic development and evaluation for CAVD.",2020 Mar
253,"Huang Z,Wang SL,Huang QS,Li XD,Chen H,Lin JH",Clinicopathological value of ErbB2 gene and protein expression in osteochondroma.,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate ErbB2 expression in osteochondroma and its relationship with clinicopathologic features of osteochondroma, so as to identify a new biomarker for the malignant transformation potential of osteochondroma. Methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to investigate the expression status of ErbB2 protein and gene in 30 osteochondroma tissues and 20 non-neoplastic bone tissues. The association of ErbB2 gene and protein expression with clinicopathological parameters of osteochondroma was analyzed by using the χ2 test and Fishers exact test. Results: ErbB2 protein was found to be over-expressed in 4 of 30 (13.3%) osteochondromas and 1 of 20 (5%) non-neoplastic bone samples, which were not statistically significant (p=0.336). However, 13 of the 30 (43.3%) osteochondromas showed ErbB2 gene amplification, which was failed to be observed in any of the non-neoplastic bone tissue. ErbB2 gene amplification in osteochondroma was significantly higher compared with that in non-neoplastic bone tissue (p=0.001). In addition, the ErbB2 gene amplification was closely associated with clinical pathological parameters of osteochondroma, including high expression of cellularity (p=0.001), presence of binucleated cells (p=0.001), nuclear pleomorphism (p=0.003), calcification (p=0.002), nodularity (p=0.002), necrosis (p=0.009) and cartilage thickness (p=0.026). The association of the gene amplification with other clinicopathological parameters of osteochondroma, including permeation of trabecular bone, cystic/mucoid changes, mitosis, radiographic appearance, cap volume and subtype of osteochondroma was not observed. The over-expression of ErbB2 protein was not found to be associated with the above stated clinical pathological parameters of osteochondroma. Conclusion: ErbB2 gene amplification was associated with adverse clinicopathological status of osteochondroma and could serve as an index for malignant conversion of osteochondroma. Further research is required to verify the predictive values of ErbB2 for osteochondroma. Level of Evidence: Level IV, Diagnostic Study",2020 Jan
254,"Hou K,Tsujioka K,Yang C",Optimization of HU threshold for coronary artery calcium scans reconstructed at 0.5‐mm slice thickness using iterative reconstruction.,"Purpose: This work investigated the simultaneous influence of tube voltage, tube current, body size, and HU threshold on calcium scoring reconstructed at 0.5‐mm slice thickness using iterative reconstruction (IR) through multivariate analysis. Regression results were used to optimize the HU threshold to calibrate the resulting Agatston scores to be consistent with those obtained from the conventional protocol. Methods: A thorax phantom set simulating three different body sizes was used in this study. A total of 14 coronary artery calcium (CAC) protocols were studied, including 1 conventional protocol reconstructed at 3‐mm slice thickness, 1 FBP protocol, and 12 statistical IR protocols (3 kVp values*4 SD values) reconstructed at 0.5‐mm slice thickness. Three HU thresholds were applied for calcium identification, including 130, 150, and 170 HU. A multiple linear regression method was used to analyze the impact of kVp, SD, body size, and HU threshold on the Agatston scores of three calcification densities for IR‐reconstructed CAC scans acquired with 0.5‐mm slice thickness. Results: Each regression relationship has R2 larger than 0.80, indicating a good fit to the data. Based on the regression models, the HU thresholds as a function of SD estimated to ensure the quantification accuracy of calcium scores for 120‐, 100‐, and 80‐kVp CAC scans reconstructed at 0.5‐mm slice thickness using IR for three different body sizes were proposed. Our results indicate that the HU threshold should be adjusted according to the imaging condition, whereas a 130‐HU threshold is appropriate for 120‐kVp CAC scans acquired with SD = 55 for body size of 24.5 cm. Conclusion: The optimized HU thresholds were proposed for CAC scans reconstructed at 0.5‐mm slice thickness using IR. Our study results may provide a potential strategy to improve the reliability of calcium scoring by reducing partial volume effect while keeping radiation dose as low as reasonably achievable.",2020 Feb
255,Finsterer J,MELAS Missed for Years: Stroke-Like Lesions Are No Indication for Brain Biopsy.,"A 56-year-old female with a history of chronic alcoholism until age 38 y with a relapse between ages 45 and 46 y developed seizures, psychosis, and hemianopia to the left at age 46 y. Imaging revealed a right parieto-occipital lesion with intralesional bleeding. Five months after the first lesion she developed a second left parieto-occipital lesion, resulting in cortical blindness. Extensive workup, including brain biopsy, was noninformative. Retrospectively, the occipital abnormalities were identified as stroke-like lesions (SLLs). Further manifestations of the mitochondrial disorder (MID) were tremor, cerebral atrophy, bilateral basal ganglia, calcification, glaucoma, hypoacusis, short stature, hyperostosis frontalis, hyperthyroidism, sick-sinus syndrome and AV-block-1, and myopathy. According to the Walker criteria, a possible MID was diagnosed. In conclusion, adult-onset MID may be missed for years, SLLs may be easily misinterpreted entailing brain biopsy, and psychosis may contribute to a reduced impact for proper workup of a MID.",2019

Whether RA controls ectopic calcification in humans is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that RA regulates osteogenic differentiation of human arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC) and aortic valvular interstitial cells (VIC) that participate respectively in atherosclerosis and heart valve disease. Approach and Results -: Human cardiovascular tissue contains immunoreactive retinoic acid receptor (RAR), a retinoid-activated nuclear receptor directing multiple transcriptional programs. RA stimulation suppressed primary human cardiovascular cell calcification while treatment with the RAR inhibitor AGN 193109 or RARα siRNA increased calcification. RA attenuated calcification in a coordinated manner – increasing levels of the calcification inhibitor matrix Gla protein while decreasing calcification-promoting tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase activity. Given that nuclear receptor action varies as a function of distinct ligand structures, we compared calcification responses to cyclic retinoids and the acyclic retinoid, peretinoin. Peretinoin suppressed human cardiovascular cell calcification without inducing either secretion of apolipoprotein-CIII, which promotes atherogenesis, or reducing cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 expression, which occurred with cyclic retinoids all-trans retinoic acid, 9-cis retinoic acid, and 13-cis retinoic acid. Additionally, peretinoin did not suppress human femur osteoblast mineralization, whereas all-trans retinoic acid inhibited osteoblast mineralization. Conclusions -: These results establish retinoid regulation of human cardiovascular calcification, provide new insight into mechanisms involved in these responses, and suggest selective retinoid modulators, like acyclic retinoids may allow for treating cardiovascular calcification without the adverse effects associated with cyclic retinoids.",2020 Mar
257,Šteiner I,Pathology of radiation induced heart disease.,"The aim of this paper is dual — to review the relevant literature on pathology of radiation induced heart disease (RIHD), and to present an illustrative case of our own. Therapeutic ionizing radiation, such as that used in the treatment of Hodgkin´s lymphoma and cancers of left breast, lungs, esophagus, and thymus, can cause cardiac damage that may take several years to manifest.The spectrum of RIHD is broad and includes [1] pericarditis and pericardial effusion; [2] endocardial fibrosis and valvular dysfunction; [3] nonischemic myocardial fibrosis; [4] obstructive coronary artery disease with resultant myocardial ischemia; [5] damage to the great vessels; and [6] conduction system dysfunction. Pericardial disease, however, is the most common manifestation of mediastinal irradiation. A case is described of a typical RIHD in a 52-year-old female who died from heart failure with a history of mediastinal neuroblastoma operated and irradiated at the age of 9 years. Her autopsy heart lesions comprised chronic and acute pericarditis with constrictive features, myocardial fibrosis with features of restrictive cardiomyopathy and fibrosis with calcification of the left heart valves. As a unique lesion, there were small calcifications in the mural endocardium and in the large arterial intima. This finding seems to be diagnostic for RIHD.",2020 Mar-Apr
258,"Gosling S,Scott R,Greenwood C,Bouzy P,Nallala J,Lyburn ID,Stone N,Rogers K",Calcification Microstructure Reflects Breast Tissue Microenvironment.,"Microcalcifications are important diagnostic indicators of disease in breast tissue. Tissue microenvironments differ in many aspects between normal and cancerous cells, notably extracellular pH and glycolytic respiration. Hydroxyapatite microcalcification microstructure is also found to differ between tissue pathologies, including differential ion substitutions and the presence of additional crystallographic phases. Distinguishing between tissue pathologies at an early stage is essential to improve patient experience and diagnostic accuracy, leading to better disease outcome. This study explores the hypothesis that microenvironment features may become immortalised within calcification crystallite characteristics thus becoming indicators of tissue pathology. In total, 55 breast calcifications incorporating 3 tissue pathologies (benign – B2, ductal carcinoma in-situ - B5a and invasive malignancy - B5b) from archive formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded core needle breast biopsies were analysed using X-ray diffraction. Crystallite size and strain were determined from 548 diffractograms using Williamson-Hall analysis. There was an increased crystallinity of hydroxyapatite with tissue malignancy compared to benign tissue. Coherence length was significantly correlated with pathology grade in all basis crystallographic directions (P < 0.01), with a greater difference between benign and in situ disease compared to in-situ disease and invasive malignancy. Crystallite size and non-uniform strain contributed to peak broadening in all three pathologies. Furthermore, crystallite size and non-uniform strain normal to the basal planes increased significantly with malignancy (P < 0.05). Our findings support the view that tissue microenvironments can influence differing formation mechanisms of hydroxyapatite through acidic precursors, leading to differential substitution of carbonate into the hydroxide and phosphate sites, causing significant changes in crystallite size and non-uniform strain.",2019

A breast phantom consisting of several slabs of breast-adipose equivalent material with different embedded targets (i.e., masses, fibers and calcifications) was used. Phantom images were acquired using a dedicated BCT system installed at the Radboud University Medical Center (Nijmegen, The Netherlands) and the SR BCT system at the SYRMEP beamline of Elettra SR facility (Trieste, Italy) based on a photon-counting detector. Images with the SR setup were acquired mimicking the clinical BCT conditions (i.e., energy of 30 keV and radiation dose of 6.5 mGy). Images were reconstructed with an isotropic cubic voxel of 273 µm for the clinical BCT, while for the SR setup two phase-retrieval (PhR) kernels (referred to as “smooth” and “sharp”) were alternatively applied to each projection before tomographic reconstruction, with voxel size of 57 × 57 × 50 µm3. The CNR for the clinical BCT system can be up to 2-times higher than SR system, while the SNR can be 3-times lower than SR system, when the smooth PhR is used. The peak frequency of the NPS for the SR BCT is 2 to 4-times higher (0.9 mm−1 and 1.4 mm−1 with smooth and sharp PhR, respectively) than the clinical BCT (0.4 mm−1). The spatial resolution (MTF10%) was estimated to be 1.3 lp/mm for the clinical BCT, and 5.0 lp/mm and 6.7 lp/mm for the SR BCT with the smooth and sharp PhR, respectively. The smallest fiber visible in the SR BCT has a diameter of 0.15 mm, while for the clinical BCT is 0.41 mm. Calcification clusters with diameter of 0.13 mm are visible in the SR BCT, while the smallest diameter for the clinical BCT is 0.29 mm. As expected, the image quality of the SR BCT outperforms the clinical BCT system, providing images with higher spatial resolution and SNR, and with finer granularity. Nevertheless, this study assesses the image quality gap quantitatively, giving indications on the benefits associated with SR BCT and providing a benchmarking basis for its clinical implementation. In addition, SR-based studies can provide a gold-standard in terms of achievable image quality, constituting an upper-limit to the potential clinical development of a given technique.",2019

Methods: Following a systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library included articles underwent subjective quality assessment with categories low, medium, and high. Of 2811 records, 1780 remained after removal of duplicates. Screening by title and abstract left 41 potentially eligible full-text articles, of which 8 (about the aortic valve (n = 1), PET/MRI feasibility (n = 1), aortic aneurysms (n = 1), or quantification methodology (n = 5)) were dismissed, leaving 33 published 2010–2012 (n = 6), 2013–2015 (n = 11), and 2016–2018 (n = 16) for analysis. Results: They focused on coronary (n = 8), carotid (n = 7), and femoral arteries (n = 1), thoracic aorta (n = 1), and infrarenal aorta (n = 1). The remaining 15 studies examined more than one arterial segment. The literature was heterogeneous: few studies were designed to investigate atherosclerosis, 13 were retrospective, 9 applied both FDG and NaF as tracers, 24 NaF only. Subjective quality was low in one, medium in 13, and high in 19 studies. The literature indicates that NaF is a very specific tracer that mimics active arterial wall microcalcification, which is positively associated with cardiovascular risk. Arterial NaF uptake often presents before CT-calcification, tends to decrease with increasing density of CT-calcification, and appears, rather than FDG-avid foci, to progress to CT-calcification. It is mainly surface localized, increases with age with a wide scatter but without an obvious sex difference. NaF-avid microcalcification can occur in fatty streaks, but the degree of progression to CT-calcification is unknown. It remains unknown whether medical therapy influences microcalcification. The literature held no therapeutic or randomized controlled trials. Conclusion: The literature was heterogeneous and with few clear cut messages. NaF-PET is a new approach to detect and quantify microcalcification in early-stage atherosclerosis. NaF uptake correlates with cardiovascular risk factors and appears to be a good measure of the body’s atherosclerotic burden, potentially suited also for assessment of anti-atherosclerotic therapy.

Objective: The objective of this article is to examine the association between BMD and BAC in a large cohort of postmenopausal women undergoing routine mammography. Design: A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a multiethnic cohort was performed. Setting: The setting for this analysis is an integrated health care delivery system in Northern California in the United States. Patients: A total of 1273 women age 60 to 79 years (mean age, 67 years) were recruited within 12 months of screening mammography. Main outcome measure: A BAC score (mg) was obtained from digital mammograms using a novel densitometry method. BAC presence was defined as a BAC score greater than 0 mg, and severe BAC as a BAC score greater than 20 mg. Results: Overall, 53% of women had osteopenia and 21% had osteoporosis. The prevalence of BAC greater than 0 mg was 29%, 30%, and 29% among women with normal BMD, osteopenia, and osteoporosis, respectively (P = 0.98). The prevalence of BAC greater than 20 mg was 5%, 3%, and 5% among women with normal BMD, osteopenia and osteoporosis, respectively (P = .65). The odds ratios (ORs) of BAC greater than 0 mg vs BAC = 0 mg after multivariable adjustment were 1.09 (95% CI, 0.81-1.48; P = .54) for osteopenia and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.69-1.48; P = .98) for osteoporosis. The adjusted ORs for BAC greater than 20 mg vs BAC 20 mg or less were 1.03 (95% CI, 0.52-2.01; P = .93) for osteopenia and 1.89 (95 CI, 0.81-4.47; P = .14) for osteoporosis.

Materials and Methods: Conventional and CEUS were performed in 86 abnormal cervical lymph nodes (ACLNs) from 56 PTC patients who had received thyroidectomy. Then, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was taken to confirm pathological results, a multivariate analysis was performed to correlate the sonographic features of the CLNM, and then an equation for CLNM was established. Results: Fifty-four lymph nodes were confirmed to be metastasis of PTC by FNA. Intensity at peak time, homogeneity, and color flow patterns, cystic change, or microcalcification and echogenicity were significantly associated with CLNM. Multivariate analysis showed three strongest features (homogeneity, intensity of peak, and cystic change or calcification) to be significantly associated with the evidence of CLNM. Then, the equation was established with the following significant predictive factors: P = 1/1 + exp∑[−3.213 + 2.77 ∗ cystic or calcification + 0.13 ∗ CDFI patterns + 3.65 ∗ homogeneity + 2.43 ∗ intensity at peak time].

263,"Tajbakhsh A,Kovanen PT,Rezaee M,Banach M,Sahebkar A",Ca2+ Flux: Searching for a Role in Efferocytosis of Apoptotic Cells in Atherosclerosis.,"In atherosclerosis, macrophages in the arterial wall ingest plasma lipoprotein-derived lipids and become lipid-filled foam cells with a limited lifespan. Thus, efficient removal of apoptotic foam cells by efferocytic macrophages is vital to preventing the dying foam cells from forming a large necrotic lipid core, which, otherwise, would render the atherosclerotic plaque vulnerable to rupture and would cause clinical complications. Ca2+ plays a role in macrophage migration, survival, and foam cell generation. Importantly, in efferocytic macrophages, Ca2+ induces actin polymerization, thereby promoting the formation of a phagocytic cup necessary for efferocytosis. Moreover, in the efferocytic macrophages, Ca2+ enhances the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Various Ca2+ antagonists have been seminal for the demonstration of the role of Ca2+ in the multiple steps of efferocytosis by macrophages. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo experiments and clinical investigations have revealed the capability of Ca2+ antagonists in attenuating the development of atherosclerotic plaques by interfering with the deposition of lipids in macrophages and by reducing plaque calcification. However, the regulation of cellular Ca2+ fluxes in the processes of efferocytic clearance of apoptotic foam cells and in the extracellular calcification in atherosclerosis remains unknown. Here, we attempted to unravel the molecular links between Ca2+ and efferocytosis in atherosclerosis and to evaluate cellular Ca2+ fluxes as potential treatment targets in atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.",2019 Dec

The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of calcifications in thyroid tissue samples of patients with various thyroid diseases, and to identify their composition according to their localization. Among 50 thyroid samples included, 56% were malignant (papillary carcinoma) and 44% were benign (adenoma, multinodular goiter, Graves’ disease, sarcoidosis). Calcifications were found in 95% of samples using polarised light microscopy, whereas only 12% were described in initial pathological reports. Three types were individualised and analyzed by infrared spectrometry (μFTIR): colloid calcifications composed of calcium oxalate, capsular calcifications and psammoma bodies, both composed of calcium phosphate. Of notice, psammoma bodies characterized by FE-SEM were composed of concentric structure suggesting a slow process for crystal deposition. Calcium phosphates were found only in malignant samples whereas calcium oxalate was not associated with a define pathology. Proliferation assessed by KI67 staining was high (33% of positive follicles), and RUNX2, OPN, and CD44 positive staining were detected in thyrocytes with a broad variation between samples. However, thyrocyte proliferation and differentiation markers were not associated with the number of crystals. TRPV5 and CaSR expression was also detected in thyrocytes. mRNA transcripts expression was confirmed in a subgroup of 10 patients, altogether with other calcium transporters such as PMCA1 or Cav1.3. Interestingly, TRPV5 mRNA expression was significantly associated with number of colloid calcifications (rho = -0.72; p = 0.02).

Methods:: Thirty-two clinical DBT data sets with malignant and benign findings, n = 27 and 17, respectively, were reconstructed using FBP and HBI. Three experienced radiologists evaluated the images independently using a 5-point visual grading scale and classified breast density according to the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging-Reporting And Data System Atlas, fifth edition. Image quality metrics included lesion conspicuity, clarity of lesion borders and spicules, noise level, artifacts surrounding the lesion, visibility of parenchyma and breast density. Results:: For masses, the image quality of HBI reconstructions was superior to that of FBP in terms of conspicuity,clarity of lesion borders and spicules (p < 0.01). HBI and FBP were not significantly different in calcification conspicuity. Overall, HBI reduced noise and supressed artifacts surrounding the lesions better (p < 0.01). The visibility of fibroglandular parenchyma increased using the HBI method (p < 0.01). On average, five cases per radiologist were downgraded from BI-RADS breast density category C/D to A/B. Conclusion:: HBI significantly improves lesion visibility compared to FBP. HBI-visibility of breast parenchyma increased, leading to a lower breast density rating. Applying the HBIR algorithm should improve the diagnostic performance of DBT and decrease the need for additional imaging in patients with dense breasts. Advances in knowledge:: Iterative heuristic Bayesian inference (HBI) image reconstruction substantially improves the image quality of breast tomosynthesis leading to a better visibility of breast carcinomas and reduction of the perceived breast density compared to the widely-used filtered-back projection (FPB) reconstruction. Applying HBI should improve the accuracy of breast tomosynthesis and reduce the number of unnecessary breast biopsies.

Methods: Marker mechanical properties were evaluated by tensile tests. Biocompatibility was evaluated following 8–12 weeks’ implantation in a pig model. Proof-of-concept of marker application was performed in a human cadaveric shoulder model, and methods for CT imaging and measurement of dimensions were established. Lastly, the method of clinical use of the markers was described in one patient undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR). Results: The radiopaque markers had a tensile strength of 28 ±4.7 N and were associated with minimal to mild inflammatory tissue reaction similar to polypropylene control. CT-based measurements showed relatively high precisions for lengths (0.66 mm), areas (6.97 mm2), and humeral orientation angles (2.1°) in the cadaveric model, and demonstrated 19 ±3 mm medio-lateral tendon retraction and 227 ±3 mm2 increase in tendon area in the patient during 26 weeks following RCR. No radiographic leaching, calcification or local adverse events were observed. Conclusions: The radiopaque tissue marker was biocompatible and had adequate strength for handling and affixation to soft tissues using standard suturing techniques.

Numerous reports of patients with Sjögren’s syndrome have described kidney damage, mainly involving distal tubule dysfunction, severe renal calcification, kidney stones, and rickets. We herein describe a patient with primary Sjögren’s syndrome who developed type I renal tubular acidosis with hypokalemia as the first symptom. This case highlights the possibility that an underlying autoimmune disorder should be considered in a patient presenting with distal tubular acidosis or recurrent hypokalemic periodic paralysis because treatment of the primary disease improves the outcome.",2020 Feb
270,"Martínez-González J,Varona S,Cañes L,Galán M,Briones AM,Cachofeiro V,Rodríguez C",Emerging Roles of Lysyl Oxidases in the Cardiovascular System: New Concepts and Therapeutic Challenges.,"Lysyl oxidases (LOX and LOX-likes (LOXLs) isoenzymes) belong to a family of copper-dependent enzymes classically involved in the covalent cross-linking of collagen and elastin, a pivotal process that ensures extracellular matrix (ECM) stability and provides the tensile and elastic characteristics of connective tissues. Besides this structural role, in the last years, novel biological properties have been attributed to these enzymes, which can critically influence cardiovascular function. LOX and LOXLs control cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, differentiation, oxidative stress, and transcriptional regulation and, thereby, their dysregulation has been linked to a myriad of cardiovascular pathologies. Lysyl oxidase could modulate virtually all stages of the atherosclerotic process, from endothelial dysfunction and plaque progression to calcification and rupture of advanced and complicated plaques, and contributes to vascular stiffness in hypertension. The alteration of LOX/LOXLs expression underlies the development of other vascular pathologies characterized by a destructive remodeling of the ECM, such as aneurysm and artery dissections, and contributes to the adverse myocardial remodeling and dysfunction in hypertension, myocardial infarction, and obesity. This review examines the most recent advances in the study of LOX and LOXLs biology and their pathophysiological role in cardiovascular diseases with special emphasis on their potential as therapeutic targets.",2019 Oct

However, the correlation between CT imaging features, described using standard report terms, and clinical characteristics, Masaoka–Koga stages, and World Health Organization (WHO) classifications of patients with thymomas has not been described in detail nor has risk factor analysis been conducted.Methods: Overall, 159 patients with thymomas who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced CT between September 2011 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. We assessed the clinical information, CT imaging features, and pathological findings for each patient. A total of 89 patients were specially used to evaluate postoperative recurrence or metastasis between September 2011 and December 2015 to obtain an appropriate observation period. The relationship between CT imaging features and clinical characteristics, Masaoka–Koga stage, and WHO histological classification were analyzed, and related risk factors based on CT imaging features were identified.Results: CT imaging features did not significantly differ based on sex or age. Some imaging features demonstrated significant differences between the groups with and without related clinical characteristics. Contour (odds ratio [OR] = 3.711, P = 0.005), abutment ≥50% (OR = 4.277, P = 0.02), and adjacent lung abnormalities (OR = 3.916 P = 0.031) were independent risk factors for relapse or metastasis. Among all imaging features, there were significant differences between stage I/II and III/IV lesions in tumor size, calcification, infiltration of surrounding fat, vascular invasion, pleural nodules, elevated hemidiaphragm, and pulmonary nodules. Tumor size (odds ratio = 1.261, P = 0.014), vascular invasion (OR = 2.526, P = 0.023), pleural nodules (OR = 2.22, P = 0.048), and pulmonary nodules (OR = 3.106, P = 0.006) were identified as independent risk factors. Tumor size, contour, internal density, infiltration of surrounding fat, and pleural effusion significantly differed between low- and high-risk thymomas. Tumor size (OR = 1.183, P = 0.048), contour (OR = 2.288, P = 0.003), internal density (OR = 2.192, P = 0.024), and infiltration of surrounding fat (OR = 2.811 P = 0.005) were independent risk factors.Conclusions: Some CT imaging features demonstrated significant correlations with clinical characteristics, Masaoka–Koga clinical stages, and WHO histological classifications in patients with thymomas. Familiarity with CT features identified as independent risk factors for these related clinical characteristics can facilitate preoperative evaluation and treatment management for the patients with thymoma.",2019
272,"Butner JD,Fuentes D,Ozpolat B,Calin GA,Zhou X,Lowengrub J,Cristini V,Wang Z",A multiscale agent-based model of ductal carcinoma in situ.,"Objective:: we present a multiscale agent-based model of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) in order to gain a detailed understanding of the cell-scale population dynamics, phenotypic distributions, and the associated interplay of important molecular signaling pathways that are involved in DCIS ductal invasion into the duct cavity (a process we refer to as duct advance rate here). Methods:: DCIS is modeled mathematically through a hybridized discrete cell-scale model and a continuum molecular scale model, which are explicitly linked through a bidirectional feedback mechanism. Results:: we find that duct advance rates occur in two distinct phases, characterized by an early exponential population expansion, followed by a long-term steady linear phase of population expansion, a result that is consistent with other modeling work. We further found that the rates were influenced most strongly by endocrine and paracrine signaling intensity, as well as by the effects of cell density induced quiescence within the DCIS population. Conclusion:: our model analysis identified a complex interplay between phenotypic diversity that may provide a tumor adaptation mechanism to overcome proliferation limiting conditions, allowing for dynamic shifts in phenotypic populations in response to variation in molecular signaling intensity. Further, sensitivity analysis determined DCIS axial advance rates and calcification rates were most sensitive to cell cycle time variation. Significance:: this model may serve as a useful tool to study the cell-scale dynamics involved in DCIS initiation and intraductal invasion, and may provide insights into promising areas of future experimental research.",2020 May

Here we measured serum calcium, phosphate, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), osteoprotegerin, osteocalcin, osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase and its bone isoenzyme, subsequently correlating them with an adverse cardiovascular outcome after 3 years of follow-up. The extent of brachiocephalic artery stenosis, CA, or CAC, as well as prevalence of osteopoenia/osteoporosis before the coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, did not differ between outcome groups, suggesting that subtle molecular mechanisms might be involved in determining the outcome rather than clinical or subclinical disease. After stepwise logistic regression, serum osteocalcin > 26.8 ng/mL and PTH > 49.1 pg/mL were independent predictors of an adverse outcome. Serum ionised calcium correlated with multivessel coronary artery disease; moreover, patients with severe CA (SYNTAX score > 21) had higher serum ionised calcium than those with mild CA. Likewise, serum alkaline phosphatase was associated with severe CA and CAC (Agatston score > 400). In conclusion, serum PTH, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase are associated with an adverse cardiovascular outcome 3 years after CABG surgery regardless of osteopoenia/osteoporosis, coronary/peripheral atherosclerosis, and CAC.",2019 Dec

Materials and Methods: One hundred ninety-four lesions with microcalcifications for which surgical excision was performed were independently reviewed by two radiologists according to the 5th edition of BI-RADS. Each category's positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated and a scoring system was developed using multivariate logistic regression. The scores for benign and malignant lesions or BI-RADS categories were compared using an independent t test or by ANOVA. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was assessed to determine the discriminatory ability of the scoring system. Our scoring system was validated using an external dataset. Results: After excision, 69 lesions were malignant (36%). The PPV of BI-RADS descriptors and categories for calcification showed significant differences. Using the developed scoring system, mean scores for benign and malignant lesions or BI-RADS categories were significantly different (p < 0.001). The AUROC of our scoring system was 0.874 (95% confidence interval, 0.840–0.909) and the PPV of each BI-RADS category determined by the scoring system was as follows: category 3 (0%), 4A (6.8%), 4B (19.0%), 4C (68.2%), and 5 (100%). The validation set showed an AUROC of 0.905 and PPVs of 0%, 8.3%, 11.9%, 68.3%, and 94.7% for categories 3, 4A, 4B, 4C, and 5, respectively. Conclusion: A scoring system based on BI-RADS morphology and distribution descriptors could be used to stratify the malignancy risk of mammographic microcalcifications.",2019 Dec
275,Krishna SM,Vitamin D as A Protector of Arterial Health: Potential Role in Peripheral Arterial Disease Formation.,"Atherosclerotic occlusive diseases and aneurysms that affect large and medium-sized arteries outside the cardiac and cerebral circulation are collectively known as peripheral arterial disease (PAD). With a rise in the rate of aging population worldwide, the number of people diagnosed with PAD is rapidly increasing. The micronutrient vitamin D is an important steroid hormone that acts on many crucial cellular mechanisms. Experimental studies suggest that optimal levels of vitamin D have beneficial effects on the heart and blood vessels; however, high vitamin D concentrations have been implicated in promoting vascular calcification and arterial stiffness. Observations from various clinical studies shows that deficiency of vitamin D has been associated with a greater risk of PAD. Epidemiological studies have often reported an inverse relation between circulating vitamin D status measured in terms of 25-hydroxivitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and increased cardiovascular disease risk; however, randomized controlled trials did not show a consistent positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular disease risk or events. Even though PAD shares all the major risk factors with cardiovascular diseases, the effect of vitamin D deficiency in PAD is not clear. Current evidence suggests a strong role of vitamin D in promoting genomic and epigenomic changes. This review summarises the current literature that supports the notion that vitamin D deficiency may promote PAD formation. A better understanding of underlying pathological mechanisms will open up new therapeutic possibilities which is the main unmet need in PAD management. Furthermore, epigenetic evidence shows that a more holistic approach towards PAD prevention that incorporates a healthy lifestyle, adequate exercise and optimal nutrition may be more effective in protecting the genome and maintaining a healthy vasculature.",2019 Oct

Such cancers often derive from the breasts or the lungs, or very rarely from thyroid carcinoma. We described the case of a 60-year-old woman who presented with headaches and pain to the right eye. CT and MRI scans of the head revealed a sellar mass compressing the optic chiasm and invading the cavernous sinus. Her serum prolactin level was 1720 mIU/L. The preoperative diagnosis was pituitary adenoma. An endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach was used to remove the tumor. Immunohistochemistry revealed immunoreactivity for thyroid transcription factor-1, CK-7, TG, supporting the diagnosis of a metastatic thyroid carcinoma. The rechecked thyroid ultrasonography showed a nodus with calcification on the left side. A total thyroidectomy was performed with a final histopathological diagnosis of minimally invasive follicular thyroid carcinoma. She was advised to take 131I treatment. The relevant literature is reviewed in light of this unusual case, illustrating the problems in the diagnosis and management of this type of patient.",2019
277,Proudfoot D,Calcium Signaling and Tissue Calcification.,"Calcification is a regulated physiological process occurring in bones and teeth. However, calcification is commonly found in soft tissues in association with aging and in a variety of diseases. Over the last two decades, it has emerged that calcification occurring in diseased arteries is not simply an inevitable build-up of insoluble precipitates of calcium phosphate. In some cases, it is an active process in which transcription factors drive conversion of vascular cells to an osteoblast or chondrocyte-like phenotype, with the subsequent production of mineralizing “matrix vesicles.” Early studies of bone and cartilage calcification suggested roles for cellular calcium signaling in several of the processes involved in the regulation of bone calcification. Similarly, calcium signaling has recently been highlighted as an important component in the mechanisms regulating pathological calcification. The emerging hypothesis is that ectopic/pathological calcification occurs in tissues in which there is an imbalance in the regulatory mechanisms that actively prevent calcification. This review highlights the various ways that calcium signaling regulates tissue calcification, with a particular focus on pathological vascular calcification.",2019 Oct
278,"Sallam T,Tintut Y,Demer LL",Regulation of Calcific Vascular and Valvular Disease by Nuclear Receptors.,"Purpose of review:: This review addresses recent developments in studies of lipid regulation of calcific disease of arteries and cardiac valves, including the role of nuclear receptors. The role of lipid-soluble signals and their receptors is timely given the recent evidence and concerns that lipid-lowering treatment may increase the rate of progression of coronary artery calcification, which has been long associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Understanding the mechanisms will be important for interpreting such clinical information. Recent findings:: New findings support regulation of calcific vascular and valvular disease by nuclear receptors, including the vitamin D receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, nutrient-sensing nuclear receptors (liver X receptor, farnesoid X receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors), and sex hormone (estrogen and androgen) receptors. There were two major unexpected findings: First, vitamin D supplementation, which was previously believed to prevent or reduce vascular calcification, showed no cardiovascular benefit in large randomized, controlled trials. Second, both epidemiological studies and coronary intravascular ultrasound studies suggest that treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors increases progression of coronary artery calcification, raising a question of whether there are mechanically stable and unstable forms of coronary calcification. Summary:: For clinical practice and research, these new findings offer new fundamental mechanisms for vascular calcification and provide new cautionary insights for therapeutic avenues.",2019 Oct

In this study, we demonstrated that aged Parp-1−/− mouse incisors showed more frequent dental dysplasia in both ICR/129Sv mixed background and C57BL/6 strain compared to aged Parp-1+/+ incisors, suggesting that Parp-1 deficiency could be involved in development of dental dysplasia at an advanced age. Computed tomography images confirmed that dental dysplasia was observed at significantly higher incidences in Parp-1−/− mice. The relative calcification levels of Parp-1−/− incisors were higher in both enamel and dentin (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed (1) Parp-1 positivity in ameloblasts and odontoblasts in Parp-1+/+ incisor, (2) weaker dentin sialoprotein positivity in dentin of Parp-1−/− incisor, and (3) bone sialoprotein positivity in dentin of Parp-1−/− incisor, suggesting ectopic osteogenic formation in dentin of Parp-1−/− incisor. These results indicate that Parp-1 deficiency promotes odontogenic failure in incisors at an advanced age. Parp-1 deficiency did not affect dentinogenesis during the development of mice, suggesting that Parp-1 is not essential in dentinogenesis during development but is possibly involved in the regulation of continuous dentinogenesis in the incisors at an advanced age.",2019 Oct
280,"Tsolaki E,Bertazzo S",Pathological Mineralization: The Potential of Mineralomics.,"Pathological mineralization has been reported countless times in the literature and is a well-known phenomenon in the medical field for its connections to a wide range of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases. The minerals involved in calcification, however, have not been directly studied as extensively as the organic components of each of the pathologies. These have been studied in isolation and, for most of them, physicochemical properties are hitherto not fully known. In a parallel development, materials science methods such as electron microscopy, spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and others have been used in biology mainly for the study of hard tissues and biomaterials and have only recently been incorporated in the study of other biological systems. This review connects a range of soft tissue diseases, including breast cancer, age-related macular degeneration, aortic valve stenosis, kidney stone diseases, and Fahr’s syndrome, all of which have been associated with mineralization processes. Furthermore, it describes how physicochemical material characterization methods have been used to provide new information on such pathologies. Here, we focus on diseases that are associated with calcium-composed minerals to discuss how understanding the properties of these minerals can provide new insights on their origins, considering that different conditions and biological features are required for each type of mineral to be formed. We show that mineralomics, or the study of the properties and roles of minerals, can provide information which will help to improve prevention methods against pathological mineral build-up, which in the cases of most of the diseases mentioned in this review, will ultimately lead to new prevention or treatment methods for the diseases. Importantly, this review aims to highlight that chemical composition alone cannot fully support conclusions drawn on the nature of these minerals.",2019 Oct
281,"Kelly MJ,Igari K,Yamanouchi D",Osteoclast-Like Cells in Aneurysmal Disease Exhibit an Enhanced Proteolytic Phenotype.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is among the top 20 causes of death in the United States. Surgical repair is the gold standard for AAA treatment, therefore, there is a need for non-invasive therapeutic interventions. Aneurysms are more closely associated with the osteoclast-like catabolic degradation of the artery, rather than the osteoblast-like anabolic processes of arterial calcification. We have reported the presence of osteoclast-like cells (OLCs) in human and mouse aneurysmal tissues. The aim of this study was to examine OLCs from aneurysmal tissues as a source of degenerative proteases. Aneurysmal and control tissues from humans, and from the mouse CaPO4 and angiotensin II (AngII) disease models, were analyzed via flow cytometry and immunofluorescence for the expression of osteoclast markers. We found higher expression of the osteoclast markers tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and cathepsin K, and the signaling molecule, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), in aneurysmal tissue compared to controls. Aneurysmal tissues also contained more OLCs than controls. Additionally, more OLCs from aneurysms express HIF-1α, and produce more MMP-9 and cathepsin K, than myeloid cells from the same tissue. These data indicate that OLCs are a significant source of proteases known to be involved in aortic degradation, in which the HIF-1α signaling pathway may play an important role. Our findings suggest that OLCs may be an attractive target for non-surgical suppression of aneurysm formation due to their expression of degradative proteases.",2019 Oct
282,"Zhang B,Miller VM,Miller JD",Influences of Sex and Estrogen in Arterial and Valvular Calcification.,"Vascular and cardiac valvular calcification was once considered to be a degenerative and end stage product in aging cardiovascular tissues. Over the past two decades, however, a critical mass of data has shown that cardiovascular calcification can be an active and highly regulated process. While the incidence of calcification in the coronary arteries and cardiac valves is higher in men than in age-matched women, a high index of calcification associates with increased morbidity, and mortality in both sexes. Despite the ubiquitous portending of poor outcomes in both sexes, our understanding of mechanisms of calcification under the dramatically different biological contexts of sex and hormonal milieu remains rudimentary. Understanding how the critical context of these variables inform our understanding of mechanisms of calcification—as well as innovative strategies to target it therapeutically–is essential to advancing the fields of both cardiovascular disease and fundamental mechanisms of aging. This review will explore potential sex and sex-steroid differences in the basic biological pathways associated with vascular and cardiac valvular tissue calcification, and potential strategies of pharmacological therapy to reduce or slow these processes.",2019

A specialized cell-cell adhesion protein, cadherin-11 (CDH11), contributes to inflammation and fibrosis in rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary fibrosis, and aortic valve calcification but has not been studied in myocardium after MI. MI was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending artery in mice with either heterozygous or homozygous knockout of CDH11, wild-type mice receiving bone marrow transplants from Cdh11-deficient animals, and wild-type mice treated with a functional blocking antibody against CDH11 (SYN0012). Flow cytometry revealed significant CDH11 expression in noncardiomyocyte cells after MI. Animals given SYN0012 had improved cardiac function, as measured by echocardiogram, reduced tissue remodeling, and altered transcription of inflammatory and proangiogenic genes. Targeting CDH11 reduced bone marrow–derived myeloid cells and increased proangiogenic cells in the heart 3 days after MI. Cardiac fibroblast and macrophage interactions increased IL-6 secretion in vitro. Our findings suggest that CDH11-expressing cells contribute to inflammation-driven fibrotic remodeling after MI and that targeting CDH11 with a blocking antibody improves outcomes by altering recruitment of bone marrow–derived cells, limiting the macrophage-induced expression of IL-6 by fibroblasts and promoting vascularization.",0

Material and methods: The study included 100 women divided into two groups based on presence of BAC on mammography using the WIPRO GE – DMR PLUS mammography unit. The groups included 50 BAC(+) (case group) and 50 BAC(–) (control group). BAC is defined as two linear calcific deposits forming the rail-road track pattern, with ring-like appearance in cross section. Relevant previous clinical and surgical history was taken and C-IMT was measured using B-mode ultrasonography Aplio XG (Toshiba medical systems corp., Japan) using an 8-13 MHz linear transducer within 1 cm from the proximal and distal portion of the common carotid artery and the mean value was taken. Results: All the participants included in this study were within the age group of 40-70 years. Mean age with BAC(+) was 59.18 ± 8.59 years and BAC(–) was 50.70 ± 7.93 years. Mean C-IMT in the BAC(+) group was 0.86 ± 0.21 mm vs. 0.71 ± 0.12 mm in the BAC(–) group. Chi-square test, independent t test and Spearman’s rho correlation to assess the association of the breast arterial calcification were performed. The study showed significant difference in mean C-IMT between two groups (p value < 0.001) when correlated with age, diabetes, hypertension, presence of BAC and history of surgery and drug intake. Conclusions: BAC in mammography is independently associated with C-IMT. Furthermore, apart from age and menopausal status a statistically significant positive correlation with C-IMT was observed.",2019
286,Senchukova M,"A Brief Review about the Role of Nanomaterials, Mineral-Organic Nanoparticles, and Extra-Bone Calcification in Promoting Carcinogenesis and Tumor Progression.","People come in contact with a huge number of nanoparticles (NPs) throughout their lives, which can be of both natural and anthropogenic origin and are capable of entering the body through swallowing, skin penetration, or inhalation. In connection with the expanding use of nanomaterials in various industrial processes, the question of whether there is a need to study the potentially adverse effects of NPs on human health becomes increasingly important. Despite the fact that the nature and the extent of damage caused depends on the chemical and the physical characteristics of individual NPs, there are also general mechanisms related to their toxicity. These mechanisms include the ability of NPs to translocate to various organs through endocytosis, as well as their ability to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress, inflammation, genotoxicity, metabolic changes, and potentially carcinogenesis. In this review, we discuss the main characteristics of NPs and the effects they cause at both cellular and tissue levels. We also focus on possible mechanisms that underlie the relationship of NPs with carcinogenesis. We briefly summarize the main concepts related to the role of endogenous mineral organic NPs in the development of various human diseases and their participation in extra-bone calcification. Considering data from both our studies and those published in scientific literature, we propose the revision of some ideas concerning extra-bone calcification, since it may be one of the factors associated with the initiation of the mechanisms of immunological tolerance.",2019 Sep

It is a poorly understood vascular calcification with unclear pathology that leads to vascular compromise due to vascular occlusion with endoluminal calcification. Case Report:: We report a case of a 61-year-old male with chronic kidney disease stage 5 who developed calciphylaxis. The patient was diagnosed with dry gangrene of the second and third digits of the right hand and second, third, and fourth phalanges of the left hand. Despite medical therapy and local wound care, the lesions progressively worsened with time. The patient was found to have secondary hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone was 1028 pg/mL) and underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy. In our patient, the skin lesions due to calciphylaxis completely resolved over the course of 12 months. Conclusions:: Parathyroidectomy has been associated with clinical benefit in patients with calciphylaxis. Clinicians should consider parathyroidectomy in the setting of high parathyroid hormone and calciphylaxis. Although parathyroidectomy is an effective treatment option for calciphylaxis it is not a definitive treatment and calciphylaxis can occur, though rarely, even after parathyroidectomy. There is a need to do further studies in order to confirm the efficacy of parathyroidectomy.",2019

This study investigated the role and specific molecular mechanism of miR-135-5p in regulating osteoblast differentiation and calcification. Methods: Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) was employed to interfere with the differentiation of MC3T3-E1. Then, miR-135-5p mimic or miR-135-5p inhibitor was transfected into MC3T3-E1, and quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure the expression of miR-135-5p. The expressions of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osterix (OSX), osteopontin (OPN), and osteocalcin (OCN) were determined using western blot. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured using an appropriate kit assay. Calcium nodule staining was evaluated with alizarin red staining. A luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the target of miR-135-5p. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α inhibitor (HIF1AN) overexpression was applied to investigate its own role in the mechanism and a miR-135-5p rescue experiment was also performed. Results: Overexpression of miR-135-5p promoted osteogenic differentiation and calcification, as shown by the increase in ALP activity, calcification and osteogenic marker levels, including Runx2, OSX, OPN and OCN. Knockdown of miR-135-5p yielded the opposite results. HIF1AN was confirmed as a direct target of miR-135-5p. HIF1AN overexpression inhibited osteogenic differentiation and calcification while miR-135-5p reversed these effects. Conclusions: These results indicate that miR-135-5p might have a therapeutic application related to its promotion of bone formation through the targeting of HIF1AN.",2019

Methods: A total of 710 PTMC patients between 2013 and 2016 with a diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastases were reviewed. We analyzed the sonographic features of the PTMC primary site to predict ipsilateral or central lymph node metastases in univariate and multivariate models. The ratio of abutment/perimeter of the PTMC primary site was utilized to evaluate cervical lymph node status. Results: Regarding clinical characteristics, multifocality and extrathyroidal extension were associated with cervical lymph node involvement. In the multivariate regression model, calcification and the abutment/perimeter ratio of lesions were evaluated as independent factors in level VI, ipsilateral or skip cervical lymph node metastases. The cut-off value of the ratio of abutment/perimeter of the PTMC primary site (25%) was significantly correlated with cervical lymph node metastases (P = 0.000). Conclusions: Independent sonographic features, including lesion size, lesion location, calcification, and the ratio of abutment/perimeter of the primary site, were associated with cervical lymph node metastases in PTMC patients.",2019 Aug
292,"Stapane L,Le Roy N,Hincke MT,Gautron J",The glycoproteins EDIL3 and MFGE8 regulate vesicle-mediated eggshell calcification in a new model for avian biomineralization.,"The avian eggshell is a critical physical barrier, which permits extra-uterine development of the embryo. Its formation involves the fastest known biomineralization process in vertebrates. The eggshell consists of proteins and proteoglycans that interact with the mineral phase to impart its specific microstructure and mechanical properties. In this study, we investigated the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and discoidin-like domains 3 (EDIL3) and milk fat globule–EGF factor 8 (MFGE8), two glycoproteins that are consistently detected in eggshell proteomes. We verified their common evolutionary history and identified the timing of the duplication event giving rise to these two distinct proteins. Edil3/mfge8 chromosomal locations revealed a nested syntenous relationship with other genes (hapln1/hapln3 and vcan/acan) that are also involved in vertebrate calcification. EDIL3 and MFGE8 proteins possess EGF-like and coagulation factor 5/8 (F5/8C) domains, and their 3D structures predicted that they bind calcium and extracellular vesicles. In chicken, we confirmed the presence of EDIL3 and MFGE8 proteins in eggshell, uterine fluid, and uterus. We observed that only edil3 is overexpressed in tissues in which eggshell mineralization takes place and that this overexpression occurs only at the onset of shell calcification. We therefore propose a model in which EDIL3 and, to a lesser extent, MFGE8 proteins guide vesicles containing amorphous calcium carbonate to the mineralization site. This model was supported by the observation that extracellular vesicles accumulate in uterine fluid during eggshell calcification and that they contain high levels of calcium, carbon, and oxygen that correspond to calcium carbonate.",2019 Oct 4
293,"Li Y,Cao J,Zhou Y,Mao F,Shen S,Sun Q",Mammographic casting-type calcification is an independent prognostic factor in invasive breast cancer.,"This study aimed to determine whether there is an association between mammographic casting-type calcification and other prognostic factors for invasive breast cancer. We also assessed whether casting-type calcification could be an independent prognostic factor. Invasive breast cancer patient information from January 2010 and January 2013 was retrospectively reviewed. The associations between mammographic casting-type calcification and other clinicopathological factors, including tumor size, node status, grade, progesterone receptor (PR) status, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, were analyzed. The Kaplan–Meier method and a Cox proportional hazards model were used for survival analyses of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). A total of 1155 invasive breast cancer patients who underwent definitive surgery were included, and 136 cases (11.8%) had casting-type calcification on mammography. In multivariate logistic regression, casting-type calcification was significantly associated with axillary node metastasis, ER-negativity, and HER2 overexpression. Casting-type calcification significantly decreased OS and DFS after a median follow-up of 60 months. This result remained after adjusting other prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis. Casting-type calcification is significantly linked to axillary node metastasis, ER-negativity and HER2 overexpression. Casting-type calcification is therefore an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients.",2019

We explored the association of CAD with coronary artery dose-volume parameters in patients treated with 3D-planned radiation therapy (RT). METHODS: Patients who received thoracic RT and were evaluated by cardiac computed tomography ≥ 1 year later were included. Demographic data and cardiac risk factors were retrospectively collected. Dosimetric data (mean heart dose, dmax, dmean, V50 - V5) were collected for the whole heart and for each coronary artery. A coronary artery calcium (CAC) Agatston score was calculated on a per-coronary basis and as a total score. Multivariable generalized linear mixed models were generated. The predicted probabilities were used for receiver operating characteristic analyses. RESULTS: Twenty patients with a median age of 53 years at the time of RT were included. Nine patients (45%) had ≥ 3/6 conventional cardiac risk factors. Patients received RT for breast cancer (10, 50%), lung cancer (6, 30%), or lymphoma/myeloma (4, 20%) with a median dose of 60 Gy. CAC scans were performed a median of 32 months after RT. CAC score was significantly associated with radiation dose and presence of diabetes. In a multivariable model adjusted for diabetes, segmental coronary artery dosimetric parameters (dmax, dmean, V50, V40 V30, V20, V10, and V5) were significantly associated with CAC score > 0. V50 had the highest area under the ROC curve (0.89, 95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Coronary artery radiation exposure is strongly correlated with subsequent segmental CAC score. Coronary calcification may occur soon after RT and in individuals with conventional cardiac risk factors.",2019 Oct

Our previous study demonstrated that carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1) stimulates ossification and calcification in ankylosing spondylitis and breast cancer. The current study investigated whether CA1 plays an important role in AS calcification and whether the CA inhibitor methazolamide (MTZ) has a therapeutic effect on AS. We successfully established an AS model by administration of a high-fat diet to apolipoprotein E (ApoE−/−) mice. The treated animals had significantly increased serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and nitric oxide (NO) and decreased serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), interleukin (IL-6), interferon (IFN)-γ, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1/keratinocyte-derived chemokine (CXCL1/KC), and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2)/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). The treated mice also had reduced AS plaque areas and fat accumulation, with no clear calcium deposition in the intima of the blood vessels. CA1 expression was significantly increased in the aortic lesions, particularly in calcified regions, but the expression was dramatically lower in the mice that received MTZ treatment or MTZ preventive treatment. CA1 was also highly expressed in human AS tissues and in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) with β-glycerophosphate (㒐β-GP)-induced calcification. Acetazolamide (AZ), a CA inhibitor with a chemical structure similar to MTZ, markedly suppressed calcification and reduced CA1, IL-6, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, and TNF-α expression in cultured VSMCs. Anti-CA1 small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) significantly suppressed calcification, cell proliferation, and migration, promoted apoptosis, and reduced IL-6, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, and TNF-α secretion in cultured VSMCs. These results demonstrated that CA1 expression and CA1-mediated calcification are significantly associated with AS progression. MTZ significantly alleviated AS and suppressed CA1 expression and proinflammatory cytokine secretion, indicating the potential use of this drug for AS treatment.",2019

However, a long-term use of E2 would produce side effects thus, it is imperative to discover safer and more effective drugs. Pinoresinol (PINO) has a similar chemical structure to E2. The present study aimed to investigate whether PINO could promote osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation and the potential mechanisms. After treatment with 0.1 µg/l PINO for 2 days, MC3T3-E1 cell migration was assessed by wound healing assay. Estrogen (E2) treatment served as a positive control. RT-qPCR and western blotting were used for mRNA and protein expression analyses. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay and Alizarin red staining were performed to investigate the calcification and mineralization, and the cyclic AMP (cAMP) level was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). H89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), was introduced to verify the role of cAMP/PKA in the effect of PINO on MC3T3-E1 cells. Cell viability was the highest under 48 h of 0.1 µg/l PINO treatment. After treatment with PINO, a significant increase was observed in the migration rate and the expression of collagen type I (Col-I), ALP, osteopontin (OPN), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) (P<0.01). The ALP activity and Alizarin red size in PINO and E2 groups were notably increased. The increased cAMP, PKA and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) levels were also observed in the PINO group. Furthermore, H89 co-treatment abolished the positive effects of PINO on cell viability and migration. PINO had similar effects to E2 on the osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation, and these positive effects may be attributed to the regulation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.",2019 Sep

The most common radiologic feature of a mucocele-like lesion is mammographic microcalcifications of indeterminate nature. The present report demonstrated unusual fluctuation of calcification number and a changing pattern of calcification morphology on mammography in a benign mucocele-like lesion. Case Report:: A 39-year-old female was referred to our breast clinic because of a screening mammography-detected abnormality in her right breast. The magnification mammogram of her right breast revealed approximately 8 cm of multiple adjacent masses accompanying regional coarse heterogeneous microcalcifications in the inner central area, which corresponded to multiple aggregated cystic lesions on sonography. Each cystic lesion had internal echoes of a complex cystic with solid and septated pattern. Although a biopsy was recommended, the patient refused the tissue diagnosis. During the first 12 months, the overall extent of mass and calcifications did not discernably change on magnification mammograms. However, minute focal changes in the calcification number were detected; single coarse calcification disappeared at 6-month follow-up, and new coarse calcification developed at 12-month follow-up. At 24-month follow-up magnification mammogram, coarse calcification overtly increased in number and size, and changed into a large bizarre dystrophic morphology. A pathologic diagnosis of a benign mucocele-like lesion without upgrade to atypia or malignancy was made using ultrasonography-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy and surgical excision. Conclusions:: When calcifications accompany cystic masses and chronologically change their morphologic pattern from indeterminate (coarse heterogeneous) to benign (dystrophic), a diagnosis of mucocele-like lesion should be considered.",2019

The predominant early vascular ageing (EVA) process mediated by medial vascular calcification (VC) results in a marked discrepancy between chronological and biological vascular age in CKD. Though the exact underlying mechanisms of VC and EVA are not fully elucidated, accumulating evidence indicates that cellular senescence - and subsequent chronic inflammation through the senescence-associated secretary phenotype (SASP) - plays a fundamental role in its initiation and progression. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiological links between senescence and the EVA process in CKD, with focus on cellular senescence and media VC, and potential anti-ageing therapeutic strategies of senolytic drugs targeting cellular senescence and EVA in CKD.",2019

Previously, we have found that mesenchymal progenitor cells within human AT can proliferate in three-dimensional culture under proangiogenic conditions. These cells (primed ADipose progenitor cells, PADS) robustly differentiate into adipocytes in vitro (ad-PADS). The goal of this study is to determine whether ad-PADS can form structured AT in vivo, with potential for use in surgical applications. Grafts formed from ad-PADS were compared to grafts formed from AT obtained by liposuction after implantation into nude mice. Graft volume was measured by microcomputed tomography scanning, and the functionality of cells within the graft was assessed by quantifying circulating human adiponectin. The degree of graft vascularization by donor or host vessels and the content of human or mouse adipocytes within the graft were measured using species-specific endothelial and adipocyte-specific quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction probes, and histochemistry with mouse and human-specific lectins. Our results show that ad-PADS grafted subcutaneously into nude mice induce robust vascularization from the host, continue to increase in volume over time, express the human adipocyte marker PLIN1 at levels comparable to human AT, and secrete increasing amounts of human adiponectin into the mouse circulation. In contrast, grafts composed of AT fragments obtained by liposuction become less vascularized, develop regions of calcification and decreased content of PLIN1, and secrete lower amounts of adiponectin per unit volume. Enrichment of liposuction tissue with ad-PADS improves vascularization, indicating that ad-PADS may be proangiogenic. Mechanistically, ad-PADS express an extracellular matrix gene signature that includes elements previously associated with small vessel development (COL4A1). Thus, through the formation of a proangiogenic environment, ad-PADS can form functional AT with capacity for long-term survival, and can potentially be used to improve outcomes in reconstructive and regenerative medicine.Impact Statement: This research describes the use of human mesenchymal progenitor cells for generating functional adipose tissue in vivo in a nude mouse model. Further preclinical development of the methods and insights described in this article can lead to therapeutic use of these cells in regenerative and reconstructive medicine.",2019 Jun 01
302,"Connor DE,Paulus JA,Dabestani PJ,Thankam FK,Dilisio MF,Gross RM,Agrawal DK",Therapeutic Potential of Exosomes in Rotator Cuff Tendon Healing.,"Rotator cuff tears are common musculoskeletal injuries that can cause significant pain and disability. While the clinical results of rotator cuff repair can be good, failure of tendon healing remains a significant problem. Molecular mechanisms underlying structural failure following surgical repair remain unclear. Histologically, enhanced inflammation, disorganization of the collagen fibers, calcification, apoptosis and tissue necrosis affect the normal healing process. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the ability to provide improved healing following rotator cuff repair via the release of mediators from secreted 30–100nm extracellular vesicles called exosomes. They carry regulatory proteins, mRNA and miRNA and have the ability to increase collagen synthesis and angiogenesis through increased expression of mRNA and release of proangiogenic factors and regulatory proteins that play a major role in proper tissue remodeling and preventing extracellular matrix degradation. Various studies have shown the effect of exosomes on improving outcome of cutaneous wound healing, scar tissue formation, degenerative bone disease and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. In this article, we critically reviewed the potential role of exosomes in tendon regeneration and propose the novel use of exosomes alone or seeded onto biomaterial matrices to stimulate secretion of favorable cellular factors in accelerating the healing response following rotator cuff repair.",2019 Sep

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred and five female participants were identified who had undergone CCTA and subsequent mammography in the SCOT-HEART randomised controlled trial of CCTA in patients with suspected stable angina. Mammograms were assessed visually for the presence and severity of BAC. RESULTS: BAC was identified in 93 (23%) patients. Patients with BAC were slightly older (63±7 versus 59±8 years, p<0.001), with a higher cardiovascular risk score (19±11 versus 16±10, p=0.022) and were more likely to be non-smokers (73% versus 49%, p<0.001). In patients with BAC, coronary artery calcification was present in 58 patients (62%; relative risk [RR] 1.26, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.04, 1.53; p=0.02), non-obstructive coronary artery disease in 58 (62%; RR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.54, p=0.02), and obstructive coronary artery disease in 19 (20%; RR 1.62, 95% CI: 0.98, 2.66; p=0.058). Patients without BAC were very unlikely to have severe coronary artery calcification (negative predictive value 95%) but the diagnostic accuracy of BAC to identify coronary artery disease was poor (AUC 0.547).

A total of 85 patients with cystic renal cell carcinoma, who were admitted to the Oncology Department of Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University from December 2015 to April 2017, were selected as the study group, and 70 patients with benign renal cyst, who were examined in Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University, were selected as the benign group. The patients in the two groups were examined by ultrasound and CT. The diagnostic value of ultrasound, CT, and ultrasound combined with CT in cystic renal cell carcinoma was analyzed. The sensitivity of ultrasound combined with CT was significantly higher than that of CT and ultrasound (P<0.05). The specificity and diagnostic coincidence rate of ultrasound combined with CT were significantly higher than those of CT (P<0.05). For unicapsular kidney cancer, there was no significant difference among ultrasound, CT and ultrasound combined with CT in the diagnosis of septum and wall nodule (P>0.05). For polycystic kidney cancer, there was no significant difference among ultrasound, CT and ultrasound combined with CT in the diagnosis of the presence or absence of septum (P>0.05). Ultrasound was significantly better than CT in cyst wall confounding (P<0.05). Ultrasound combined with CT was significantly better than ultrasound in calcification and blood supply of tumors (P<0.05). In conclusion, the accuracy of ultrasound combined with CT is higher than that of ultrasound or that of CT in the diagnosis of cystic renal cell carcinoma, which can be beneficial in accurately carrying out clinical diagnosis, reduce the incidence of missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis caused by a single diagnosis and treatment. Ultrasound combined with CT is good for clinical screening and can guide clinical symptomatic treatment, which is worthy of generalizing in clinic.",2019 Aug

The purpose of our study was to investigate the frequency of 99mTc-MDP uptake in extraosseous neoplasms and to assess the additional value of SPECT/CT for the localization and characterization of this unusual uptake. Methods: Data from 7308 patients (SPECT/CT was performed in 2147 patients) with known cancer who underwent WBSs for metastatic work-up between May 2015 and July 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The locations, numbers, and intensities of extraosseous 99mTc-MDP uptake were evaluated by WBS, and the intratumoural calcification was evaluated by SPECT/CT. The diagnostic accuracy of SPECT/CT in locating 99mTc-MDP uptake in extraosseous neoplasms was compared to that of WBS. Results: A total of 41 patients showed 99mTc-MDP uptake in extraosseous neoplasms. Of these patients, 23 patients had uncertain lesions by WBS, and further SPECT/CT was performed. The incidence of 99mTc-MDP uptake in extraosseous neoplasms was observed to be 0.6% by WBS and 1.1% (by) SPECT/CT. During imaging analysis, WBS had an accuracy of only 35% (14/40), whereas SPECT/CT correctly located and diagnosed all 40 lesion sites in the 23 patients. Twenty-three lesion sites (57.5%, 23/40) showed moderate or high intensity of extraosseous 99mTc-MDP uptake. Of the 23 patients, 17 patients (73.9%, 18/23) with 31 lesion sites (77.5%, 31/40) presented with intratumoural calcification. Conclusions: 99mTc-MDP uptake in extraosseous neoplasms can be observed as 0.6% on WBS and is usually localized to the breast, liver, and lung. Nuclear physicians should be familiar with such extraosseous uptake when interpreting WBSs. SPECT/CT offers better accuracy than WBS alone for locating the majority of lesions present with intratumoural calcification.",2019

Emerging evidence indicates that osteogenic differentiation of human aortic valve interstitial cells (hAVICs) plays a key role in valve calcification. In this study, we aimed to investigate the function of miR‐638 in hAVICs osteogenesis. Both miRNA microarray assay and qRT‐PCR results demonstrating miR‐638 was obviously up‐regulated in calcific aortic valves compared with non‐calcific valves. We also proved that miR‐638 was significantly up‐regulated during hAVICs osteogenic differentiation. Overexpression of miR‐638 suppressed osteogenic differentiation of hAVICs in vitro, whereas down‐regulation of miR‐638 enhance the process. Target prediction analysis and dual‐luciferase reporter assay confirmed that Sp7 transcription factor (Sp7) was a direct target of miR‐638. Furthermore, knockdown of Sp7 inhibited osteogenic differentiation of hAVICs, which is similar to the results observed in up‐regulation miR‐638. Our data indicated that miR‐638 plays an inhibitory role in hAVICs osteogenic differentiation, which may act by targeting Sp7. MiR‐638 may be a potential therapeutic target for CAVD.",2019 Aug

However, false-positive biopsy rates for calcifications range from 30% to 87%. Improved methods to differentiate benign from malignant calcifications are thus needed. Purpose:: To quantify the growth rates of DCIS and benign breast disease that manifest as mammographic calcifications. Materials and Methods:: All calcifications (n = 2359) for which a stereotactic biopsy was performed from 2008 through 2015 at Duke University Medical Center were retrospectively identified. Mammograms from all cases of DCIS (n = 404) were reviewed for calcifications that were visible on mammograms taken at least 6 months before biopsy. Women with at least one prior mammogram with visible calcifications were age- and race-matched 1:2 to women with a benign breast biopsy and calcifications visible on prior mammograms. The long axis of the calcifications was measured on all mammograms. Multivariable adjusted linear mixed-effects models estimated the association of calcification growth rates with patholo findings. Hierarchical clustering accounted for matching benign and DCIS groups. Results:: A total of 74 DCIS calcifications and 148 benign calcifications were included for final analysis. The median patient age was 62 years (interquartile range, 51–71 years). No significant difference in breast density (P > .05) or number of available mammograms (P > .05) was detected between groups. Calcifications associated with DCIS were larger than those associated with benign breast disease at biopsy (median, 10 mm vs 6 mm, respectively; P < .001). After adjustment, the relative annual increase in the long-axis length of DCIS calcifications was greater than that of benign breast calcifications (96% [95% confidence interval: 72%, 224%] vs 68% [95% confidence interval: 56%, 80%] per year, respectively; P < .001). Conclusion:: Ductal carcinoma in situ calcifications are more extensive at diagnosis and grow faster in extent than those associated with benign breast disease. The rate of calcification change may help to discriminate benign from malignant calcifications.",2019 Jul

All thyroid nodules were pathologically identified as malignant or benign. We evaluated the following ultrasound characteristics: size, location, composition, echogenicity, shape, margins, calcification or echogenic foci, and extrathyroidal extension. Each nodule was categorized using four risk-stratification systems: the American Thyroid Association (ATA) classification, the Thyroid Imaging, Reporting, and Data System (TIRADS) of the American College of Radiology (ACR-TIRADS), the European Thyroid Association TIRADS (EU-TIRADS), and the TIRADS developed by Kwak et al. (Kwak-TIRADS). The diagnostic performance of each risk-stratification system relative to the pathological results was analyzed. We used receiver operating characteristic curves to identify cutoff values that yielded optimal sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy (ACC).Results: Of the 1,612 nodules, 839 (52.0%) were benign, and 773 (48.0%) were malignant. The AUCs of the ACR-TIRADS, EU-TIRADS, Kwak-TIRADS, and ATA classification were 0.879, 0.872, 0.896, and 0.869, respectively. The Kwak-TIRADS had the best SEN, NPV, ACC, and AUC, while the ACR-TIRADS had the best SPE and PPV.Conclusion: All four risk-stratification systems had good diagnostic performances (AUCs > 86%). Considering its high SEN, NPV, ACC, and AUC, we believe that the Kwak-TIRADS may be the more effective risk-stratification system in the Chinese population.",2019

Severe abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular event and of fragility fracture. Objective: To identify miRNA linked to the aggravation of AAC and to incident osteoporotic fracture. Design: Postmenopausal women (>50 years) with available serum at inclusion and data for each outcome (Kauppila score and incident fracture) were selected from the OFELY prospective cohort. We conducted a case-control study in 434 age-matched women, 50% with incident osteoporotic fracture over 20 years of follow-up and a second study in 183 women to explore AAC over 17 years. Methods: Serum expression of three miRNA involved in vascular calcification and bone turnover regulation (miRs-26a-5p,-34a-5p, and -223-5p) was quantified at baseline by TaqMan Advanced miRNA technology and expressed by relative quantification. Outcomes were the association of miRNA levels with (1) incident osteoporotic fractures during 20 years, (2) AAC aggravation during 17 years. Results: MiRNA level was not associated with incident fractures (miR-26a-5p: 1.06 vs 0.99, p = 0.07; miR-34a-5p: 1.15 vs 1.26, p = 0.35; miR-223a-5p: 1.01 vs 1.05, p = 0.32). 93 women had an increase in Kauppila score over 17 years while 90 did not. None of the miRNAs was associated with an aggravation in AAC (miR-26a-5p: 1.09 vs 1.10, p = 0.95; miR-34a-5p: 0.78 vs 0.73, p = 0.90; miR-223-5p: 0.97 vs 0.78, p = 0.11). Conclusions: Circulating miR-26a-5p, -34a-5p and -223-5p are not significantly associated with incident fracture and AAC aggravation.",2019
311,"Wang L,Li LX,Chen DQ,Yang L,Li SK,Cheng C",Low-grade Myofibroblastic sarcoma: clinical and imaging findings.,"Background: Low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma (LGMS) is a rare type of tumor. Previous research has paid much attention to reporting pathological analyses of LGMS. However, only few systematic clinical and/or radiological studies have been conducted. Methods: This study recruited 14 cases (8 males and 6 females) of LGMS. X-ray or computer tomography (CT) scan were performed on 11 cases. MRI was performed on 5 cases. Results: X-Ray and CT scan: Five cases developed LGMS in bones, including 3 cases in the distal femur, 1 in the right shoulder blade, and another 1 in the right inferior ramus. Massive infiltrative and vermiform bone destruction with poorly-circumscribed lesion margins and partial soft tissue masses were observed. The other 9 cases were developed in soft tissues. Out of them, 4 cases presented slightly irregular hyper- or lower-density masses with poorly-circumscribed margins. 2 cases presented massive calcification and ossification. Significant enhancement was observed in 1 case, while no obvious enhancement was seen in the other 2 cases.MRI: MR images of 5 cases revealed homogeneous iso- or hyper-signal intensity on T1WI and homogeneous or heterogeneous hyper-signal intensity on T2WI. Enhanced MRI revealed homogeneous enhancement in 2 cases and rim enhancement in 1 case. Conclusions: Our findings show that LGMS is characterized by invasiveness, metastases and calcification. Different radiological tools should be employed to make an accurate diagnosis.",2019
312,"Jin Y,Kim HK,Lee J,Soh EY,Kim JH,Song I,Chung YS,Choi YJ",Transcription Factor HOXA9 is Linked to the Calcification and Invasion of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.,"Calcification is important for the diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), a master transcription factor associated with osteogenic differentiation, is reportedly related to PTC calcification and invasiveness. However, its regulatory role in this process is somewhat uncharacterized. Here, we attempted to identify genes that regulate RUNX2 and clarify its function in PTC carcinogenesis and calcification. The expression of RUNX2-upstream genes was evaluated by real-time PCR in Nthy-Ori 3-1 normal thyroid cells and TPC1 and BHP10-3 PTC cell lines. Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed with candidate genes after cloning the RUNX2 promoter. We found that RUNX2 promoter activity was enhanced by homeobox family A9 (HOXA9). Over-expression of HOXA9 was found to enhance alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization, and in vitro tumour cell migration and invasion, whereas downregulation had the opposite effects. These results indicate that HOXA9, a positive regulator of RUNX2, can enhance calcification, migration, and invasion in PTC. Our data improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of microcalcification in PTC as well as tumorigenesis.",2019

To solve this problem, in this study, we adopt a generative adversarial network (GAN) approach and design a semisupervised learning algorithm, named G2C-CAD. Methods: From the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset, we extracted four types of pulmonary nodule sign images closely related to lung cancer: noncentral calcification, lobulation, spiculation, and nonsolid/ground-glass opacity (GGO) texture, obtaining a total of 3,196 samples. In addition, we randomly selected 2,000 non-lesion image blocks as negative samples. We split the data 90% for training and 10% for testing. We designed a DCGAN generative adversarial framework and trained it on the small sample set. We also trained our designed CNN-based fuzzy Co-forest on the labeled small sample set and obtained a preliminary classifier. Then, coupled with the simulated unlabeled samples generated by the trained DCGAN, we conducted iterative semisupervised learning, which continually improved the classification performance of the fuzzy Co-forest until the termination condition was reached. Finally, we tested the fuzzy Co-forest and compared its performance with that of a C4.5 random decision forest and the G2C-CAD system without the fuzzy scheme, using ROC and confusion matrix for evaluation. Results: Four different types of lung cancer-related signs were used in the classification experiment: noncentral calcification, lobulation, spiculation, and nonsolid/ground-glass opacity (GGO) texture, along with negative image samples. For these five classes, the G2C-CAD system obtained AUCs of 0.946, 0.912, 0.908, 0.887, and 0.939, respectively. The average accuracy of G2C-CAD exceeded that of the C4.5 random decision tree by 14%. G2C-CAD also obtained promising test results on the LISS signs dataset; its AUCs for GGO, lobulation, spiculation, pleural indentation, and negative image samples were 0.972, 0.964, 0.941, 0.967, and 0.953, respectively. Conclusion: The experimental results show that G2C-CAD is an appropriate method for addressing the problem of insufficient labeled samples in the medical image analysis field. Moreover, our system can be used to establish a training sample library for CAD classification diagnosis, which is important for future medical image analysis.",2019

Although many clinical studies have reported its adverse effects on cardiovascular morbidity, the molecular mechanism of vascular calcification, especially the involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), is not yet reported. From the transcriptomic analysis, we discovered hundreds of lncRNAs differentially expressed in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) treated with inorganic phosphate, which mimics vascular calcification. We focused on Lrrc75a-as1 and elucidated its transcript structure and confirmed its cytoplasmic localization. Our results showed that calcium deposition was elevated after knockdown of Lrrc75a-as1, while its overexpression inhibited calcium accumulation in A10 cells. In addition, Lrrc75a-as1 attenuated VSMCs calcification by decreasing the expression of osteoblast-related factors. These findings suggest that Lrrc75a-as1 acts as a negative regulator of vascular calcification, and may serve as a possible therapeutic target in vascular calcification.",2019
315,"Guo QQ,Zhang SH,Niu LJ,Zhang YK,Li ZJ,Chang Q",Comprehensive evaluation of medullary thyroid carcinoma before surgery.,"Background:: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare disease, but it exhibits more aggressive behaviors. The aim of this study was to improve the diagnostic accuracy of MTC before surgery by analyzing the clinical and ultrasonic data of patients with MTC. Methods:: The study included 71 patients (96 lesions) with histopathologically proven MTC between April 2011 and September 2016 in the Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. The clinical characteristics and sonographic findings were retrospectively reviewed and compared between the ultrasonic correct diagnosis group and the ultrasonic misdiagnosis group with the t test or Mann-Whitney U test for quantitative parameters and the χ2 test or Fisher exact test for qualitative parameters. Results:: Compared with the ultrasonic correct diagnosis group, the proportion of the cystic change in the ultrasonic misdiagnosed group was high (25.0% vs. 4.2%), the uncircumscribed margin and irregular shape proportions were low (20.8%, 58.3% vs. 74.7%, 87.3%), calcification was relatively rare (20.8% vs. 56.3%), and rich vascularity was relatively rare (25.0% vs. 78.9%). Conclusions:: In the case of atypical MTC, such as cystic change, circumscribed margin, regular shape, no calcification, no rich vascularity, and normal cervical lymph nodes, MTC is easily misdiagnosed as benign by ultrasound. Therefore, ultrasound, cytology and serum calcitonin should be comprehensively evaluated for a preoperative diagnosis of MTC.",2019 Apr 5

Methods: A total of 66 TC patients admitted and treated in the Department of Oncology of our hospital from April 2014 to April 2018 were enrolled randomly. The conventional US imaging data of the patients were collected. Paired carcinoma and para-carcinoma tissues were obtained after operation to detect the expression of PCNA protein by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The correlations of PCNA expression with the patients’ US manifestations and clinical stages were analyzed. Results: The positive rate of PCNA was 72.73% (48/66) in TC tissues and 13.64% (9/66) in paired para-carcinoma tissues, displaying a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P<0.05). The PCNA and US features suggested that there was no significant difference in tumor boundary between the PCNA positive group and PCNA negative group (P>0.05). However, significant differences in tumor diameter, echo, calcification and blood flow were found between the two groups (P<0.05). The pathologic data of preoperative US diagnosis and PCNA expression in postoperative TC specimens were analyzed, and the results indicated that PCNA expression was prominently associated with T stage and N stage in US diagnosis (P<0.05). The total correct rate of US in assessing the T stage was 75.8% (50/66), and the over-staging rate and under-staging rate in evaluating the T stage were 13.6% (9/66) and 10.6% (7/66), respectively. Conclusion: The expression of PCNA protein in TC tissues is significantly correlated with the diameter, echo, calcification and blood flow of US features as well as clinical stage detected by US. PCNA level and US examination can provide certain clinical values for TC treatment.",2019
317,"Xie C,Ouyang L,Chen J,Zhang H,Luo P,Wang J,Huang H",The Emerging Role of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Vascular Calcification.,"Vascular calcification (VC), characterized by hydroxyapatite crystal depositing in the vessel wall, is a common pathological condition shared by many chronic diseases and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Recently, VC is regarded as an active, dynamic cell-mediated process, during which calcifying cell transition is critical. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with a multidirectional differentiation ability and great potential for clinical application, play a duplex role in the VC process. MSCs facilitate VC mainly through osteogenic transformation and apoptosis. Meanwhile, several studies have reported the protective role of MSCs. Anti-inflammation, blockade of the BMP2 signal, downregulation of the Wnt signal, and antiapoptosis through paracrine signaling are possible mechanisms. This review displays the evidence both on the facilitating role and on the protective role of MSCs, then discusses the key factors determining this divergence.",2019
318,"Yee Lok ZS,Lyle AN",Osteopontin in Vascular Disease: Friend or Foe?,"Inflammatory cytokines are necessary for an acute response to injury and the progressive healing process. However, when this acute response does not resolve and becomes chronic, the same proteins that once promoted healing then contribute to chronic inflammatory pathologies, such as atherosclerosis. Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted matricellular cytokine that signals through integrin and CD44 receptors, is highly upregulated in acute and chronic inflammatory settings, and has been implicated in physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. Evidence from the literature suggests that OPN may fit within the “Goldilocks” paradigm with respect to cardiovascular disease, where acute increases are protective, attenuate vascular calcification, and promote post-ischemic neovascularization. In contrast, chronic increases in OPN are clinically associated with an increased risk for a major adverse cardiovascular event and OPN expression is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease independent of traditional risk factors. With the recent finding that humans express multiple OPN isoforms as the result of alternative splicing and that these isoforms have distinct biologic functions, future studies are required to determine what OPN isoform(s) are expressed in the setting of vascular disease and what role each of these isoforms plays in vascular disease progression. This review aims to discuss our current understanding of the role(s) of OPN in vascular disease pathologies using evidence from in vitro, animal and clinical studies. Where possible, we discuss what is known about OPN isoform expression and our understanding of OPN isoform contributions to cardiovascular disease pathologies.",2019 Apr

320,"Ünal E,Karcaaltincaba M,Akpinar E,Ariyurek OM",The imaging appearances of various pericardial disorders.,"The pericardium could be involved in a variety of clinical disorders. The imaging findings are not specific for an individual pathology in most of the cases; however, patient’s clinical history may guide radiologist to a definitive diagnosis. Congenital absence of the pericardium could be recognized with the imaging appearance of interposed lung tissue between the main pulmonary artery and aorta. Pericardial effusion is a non-specific condition that may occur due to inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic disorders. Cardiac tamponade may occur in case of massive or rapid accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac. Pericardial calcification is a common and easily identified entity on a computed tomography (CT) scan. Presence of calcification and/or fibrosis may result in pericardial constriction. Nevertheless, the pulsation of an adjacent coronary artery may prevent calcification formation in a focal area and consequently may result in pericardial diverticulum containing epicardial fat and coronary artery. The imaging findings encountered in patients with pericardial hydatid disease and Erdheim-Chester disease may mimic those of pericardial neoplasia. Pericardial adhesions and pedicled fat flaps may cause confusion on a CT scan in the post-surgical period following cardiac surgery. Pericardial fat necrosis can be diagnosed by CT in patients with chest pain. The radiologists should be familiar with the medical devices placed in pericardial space for certain individual indications. A pericardial patch and temporary epicardial pacemaker wires could be identified on a CT scan.",2019 Dec
321,"Petrov D,Marshall N,Young K,Zhang G,Bosmans H",Model and human observer reproducibility for detection of microcalcification clusters in digital breast tomosynthesis images of three-dimensionally structured test object.,"We compare the reproducibility of the human observers and a channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), when reading digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images of a physical phantom containing a breast simulating structured background and calcification clusters at three dose levels. The phantom is scanned 217 times on a Siemens Inspiration DBT system. Volumes of interest, with and without the calcification targets, are extracted and the human observers’ percentage of correct (PC) scores is evaluated using a four-alternative forced choice method. A two-layer CHO is developed using the human observer results. The first layer consists of a localizing CHO that identifies the most conspicuous calcifications using two Laguerre–Gauss channels. Then a CHO with eight Gabor channels estimates the PC score for the calcification cluster. Observer reproducibility is estimated by bootstrapping, and the standard deviation (SD) is used as a figure of merit. The CHO closely approximated the human observer results for all the three dose levels with a correlation of >0.97. For the larger calcification cluster sizes, both observers have similar reproducibility, whereas the CHO is more reproducible for the smaller calcifications, with a maximum of 5.5 SD against 13.1 SD for the human observers. The developed CHO is a good candidate for automated reading of the calcification clusters of the structured phantom, with better reproducibility than the human readers for small calcifications.",2019 Jan

Our goal is to create a modular phantom with an anthropomorphic region to allow for improved lesion and calcification detection as well as a uniform region to evaluate standard quality control (QC) metrics. Previous versions of this phantom used commercial photopolymer inkjet three-dimensional printers to recreate breast anatomy using four surfaces that were fabricated with commercial materials spanning only a limited breast density range of 36% to 64%. We use modified printers to create voxelized, dithered breast phantoms with continuous gradations between glandular and adipose tissues. Moreover, the new phantom replicates the low-end density (representing adipose tissue) using third party material, Jf Flexible, and increases the high-end density to the density of glandular tissue and beyond by either doping Jf Flexible with salts and nanoparticles or using a new commercial resin, VeroPureWhite. An insert design is utilized to add masses, calcifications, and iodinated objects into the phantom for increased utility. The uniform chest wall region provides a space for traditional QC objects such as line pair patterns for measuring resolution and scale bars for measuring printer linearity. Incorporating these distinct design modules enables us to create an improved, complete breast phantom to better evaluate clinical mammography systems for lesion and calcification detection and standard QC performance evaluation.",2019 Apr

Reducing the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma is clinically emergent and important. A radiomics model is proposed in this article to predict lymph node metastasis, the most important risk factor of papillary thyroid carcinoma, based on noninvasive routine preoperative ultrasound images. Methods:: Four hundred fifty ultrasound manually segmented images of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma with lymph node status obtained from pathology report were enrolled in our retrospective study. A radiomics evaluation of 614 high-throughput features were calculated, including size, shape, margin, boundary, orientation, position, echo pattern, posterior acoustic pattern, and calcification features. Then, combined feature selection strategy was used to select features with the greatest ability to discriminate lymph node status. A support vector machine classifier was employed to build and validate the prediction model. Another independent testing cohort was used to further evaluate the performance of the radiomics model. Results:: Among 614 radiomics features, 50 selected features most reflecting echo pattern, posterior acoustic pattern, and calcification showed the superior lymph node status distinguishable performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.753, 0.740, and 0.743 separately when using each type of features predicting the lymph node status. The results of model based on all 50 final features predicting the lymph node status shown an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.782, and accuracy of 0.712. In the independent testing cohort, the proposed approach showed similar results, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.727 and accuracy of 0.710. Conclusion:: Papillary thyroid carcinoma with lymph node metastasis usually shows a complex echo pattern, posterior region homogeneity, and macrocalcification or multiple calcification. The radiomics model proposed in this article is a promising method for assessing the risk of papillary thyroid carcinoma metastasis noninvasively.",2019

Patients and methods: All 529 subjects with microcalcifications were selected from patients who had been examined using breast mammography. The control group did not have detectable microcalcifications, and was matched in a ratio of 1:3. The clinicopathological factors, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival were evaluated by SPSS. Results: There was a significant difference in tumor size between the two groups, with larger tumors in the calcification group than the control group, and the proportion of patients in the calcification group with tumors of >5 cm was 20.4% vs 17.2% in the control group (P=0.041). The proportion of patients with lymph node metastasis in the calcification group was higher than that of the control group (35% vs 27.9%, P=0.027). The recurrence rate in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patients with microcalcification was higher than that in the control group (P=0.035 and 0.044).

Loss of VSMCs through apoptotic cell death can cause fibrous cap thinning, necrotic core formation, and calcification that may destabilize plaque. Elevated glucocorticoid levels caused by psychological stress promote VSMC apoptosis and can exacerbate atherosclerosis in mice and humans. Changes in the levels of antiapoptosis microRNA-25 (miR-25) have been linked with heart disease, inflammation, VSMC phenotype, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Here, we investigated the pathways and mechanisms of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of mouse VSMCs and the protective role of miR-25. Methods: Primary mouse VSMCs were cultured +/- corticosterone for 48 h. Apoptosis, ROS, apoptotic protein activities, miR-25, MOAP1, a miR-25 target, and p70S6 kinase were quantified at intervals. The roles of miR-25 were assessed by treating cells with lenti-pre-miR-25 and anti-miR-25. Results: VSMC apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, and Bax were increased by corticosterone, and cell death was paralleled by marked loss of miR-25. Protection was conferred by pre-miR-25 and exacerbated by anti-miR-25. Pre-miR-25 conferred reduced expression of the proapoptotic protein MOAP1, and the protective effects of pre-miR-25 were abrogated by overexpressing MOAP1. The antiapoptotic effects of miR-25 were paralleled by inhibition of the p70S6K pathway, a convergence target for the survival signaling pathways, and protection by pre-miR-25 was abrogated by the p70S6k inhibitor rapamycin. Conclusions: MicroRNA-25 blocks corticosterone-induced VSMC apoptosis by targeting MOAP1 and the p70S6k pathway. Therapeutic manipulation of miR-25 may reduce atherosclerosis and unstable plaque formation associated with chronic stress.",2019

In this study, we aimed to apply SWI in patients with oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas (OTSCCs) and relate multi-parametric effect to tumor histological grade prediction. Methods: Preoperative MR examinations were performed on a 1 .5T MRI scanner with T1-, T2- and contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted imaging. In addition to routine head and neck MRI sequences, SWI was performed. Tumor thickness and volume were measured. Intratumoral susceptibility signal intensities (ITSSs), ITSS score and ITSS ratio on SWI were evaluated and recorded. Subjects were sub-grouped into low- and high-grade according to the histological findings post operation. Parameters such as tumor thickness, tumor volume and three ITSS related parameters were compared between low- and high-grade groups. ROC analysis was performed on above parameters to access the capability in predicting tumor histological grade. Different multi-parametric models were run to access multi-parametric combination effect. Results: Thirty patients with OTSCC were finally included in the study. Twenty of them were categorized as low-grade SCC and the other ten subjects were high-grade SCC according to the pathologic findings. No significant difference was seen for tumor thickness or tumor volume between two sub-groups. ITSSs were seen in 23/30 patients. Significant difference of ITSS scores between low- and high-grade OTSCCs was observed, with mean value of 0.95 ± 0.83 and 1.70 ± 0.95, respectively. Univariate ROC analysis demonstrated ITSSs, ITSS score and ITSS ratio were valuable parameters for predicting tumor histological grade and ITSSs was superior to the other two parameters, with an area under ROC curve of 0.790. Multi-parametric model using combination of ITSSs and tumor thickness would greatly improve the predictive capability in comparison with a univariate approach, yielding the area under ROC curve of 0.84(0.69,0.99). On contrast-enhanced SWI (CE-SWI), ITSSs were shown more clearly delineated in comparison with non-contrast enhanced SWI. Conclusions: In conclusion, SWI was superior in depiction of internal characteristics of OTSCCs, which would potentially provide more diagnostic information. Multi-parametric model using combination of ITSSs and tumor thickness would be valuable in predicting tumor histological grade.",2019

NOTCH1, SMAD6, and GATA5 are associated with BAV in humans, but few cases have been reported that did not involve NOTCH1. Here, we identified novel in‐frame variants in SMAD6 (c.1168_1173dup; p.Gly390_Ile391dup) in a BAV patient, who presented with dilatation of the ascending aorta and severe calcification of the aortic valve. Methods: Twenty BAV associated genes were screened by exome sequencing.

In this paper, the calcification was characterized by descriptors obtained from deep learning and handcrafted descriptors. We compared the performances of different image feature sets on digital mammograms. The feature sets included the deep features alone, the handcrafted features, their combination, and the filtered deep features. Experimental results have demonstrated that the deep features outperform handcrafted features, but the handcrafted features can provide complementary information for deep features.

AV calcification preferentially occurs on the fibrosa-side, exposed to disturbed flow (d-flow), while the ventricularis-side exposed to predominantly stable flow (s-flow) remains protected by unclear mechanisms. Here, we tested the role of novel flow-sensitive ubiquitin E2 ligase-C (UBE2C) and microRNA-483–3p (miR-483) in flow-dependent AV endothelial function and AV calcification. Approach and Results:: Human AV endothelial cells (HAVECs) and fresh porcine AV (PAV) leaflets were exposed to s-flow or d-flow. We found that UBE2C was upregulated by d-flow in HAVECs in the miR-483-dependent manner. UBE2C mediated OS-induced endothelial inflammation and endothelial-mesenchymal-transition (EndMT) by increasing the hypoxia-inducible factor1α (HIF1α) level. UBE2C increased HIF1α by ubiquitinating and degrading its upstream regulator von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL). These in vitro findings were corroborated by immunostaining studies using diseased human AV leaflets. Additionally, we found that reduction of miR-483 by d-flow led to increased UBE2C expression in HAVECs. The miR-483 mimic protected against endothelial inflammation and EndMT in HAVECs and calcification of PAV leaflets by downregulating UBE2C. Moreover, treatment with the HIF1α inhibitor (PX478) significantly reduced PAV calcification in static and d-flow conditions. Conclusions:: These results suggest that miR-483 and UBE2C are novel flow-sensitive anti- and pro-CAVD molecules, respectively, that regulate the HIF1α pathway in AV. The miR-483 mimic and HIF1α pathway inhibitors may serve as potential therapeutics of CAVD.",2019 Mar
332,"Cremers S,Drake MT,Ebetino FH,Bilezikian JP,Russell RGG",Pharmacology of bisphosphonates.,"The biological effects of the bisphosphonates (BPs) as inhibitors of calcification and bone resorption were first described in the late 1960s. In the 50 years that have elapsed since then, the BPs have become the leading drugs for the treatment of skeletal disorders characterized by increased bone resorption, including Paget's disease of bone, bone metastases, multiple myeloma, osteoporosis and several childhood inherited disorders. The discovery and development of the BPs as a major class of drugs for the treatment of bone diseases is a paradigm for the successful journey from “bench to bedside and back again”. Several of the leading BPs achieved “blockbuster” status as branded drugs. However, these BPs have now come to the end of their patent life, making them highly affordable. The opportunity for new clinical applications for BPs also exists in other areas of medicine such as ageing, cardiovascular disease and radiation protection. Their use as inexpensive generic medicines is therefore likely to continue for many years to come. Fifty years of research into the pharmacology of bisphosphonates have led to a fairly good understanding about how these drugs work and how they can be used safely in patients with metabolic bone diseases. However, while we seemingly know much about these drugs, a number of key aspects related to BP distribution and action remain incompletely understood. This review summarizes the existing knowledge of the (pre)clinical and translational pharmacology of BPs, and highlights areas in which understanding is lacking.",2019 Jun

In the present work, we provide our long-standing experience in establishing and maintaining a biobank of vascular tissue samples, including the evaluation of tissue quality, especially in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens (FFPE). Our Munich Vascular Biobank includes, thus far, vascular biomaterial from patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis (n = 1567), peripheral arterial disease (n = 703), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (n = 481) from our Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (January 2004–December 2018). Vascular tissue samples are continuously processed and characterized to assess tissue morphology, histological quality, cellular composition, inflammation, calcification, neovascularization, and the content of elastin and collagen fibers. Atherosclerotic plaques are further classified in accordance with the American Heart Association (AHA), and plaque stability is determined. In order to assess the quality of RNA from FFPE tissue samples over time (2009–2018), RNA integrity number (RIN) and the extent of RNA fragmentation were evaluated. Expression analysis was performed with two housekeeping genes—glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and beta-actin (ACTB)—using TaqMan-based quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT)-PCR. FFPE biospecimens demonstrated unaltered RNA stability over time for up to 10 years. Furthermore, we provide a protocol for processing tissue samples in our Munich Vascular Biobank.

However, it is unknown whether the distribution of these factors differs among breast cancer subtypes. We conducted a hospital‐based case‐only study consisting of 8067 breast cancer patients basing on the Tianjin Cohort of Breast Cancer Cases. Major breast cancer subtypes including luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)‐enriched and basal‐like were defined by estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2, and Ki‐67 status. Variables including demographic characteristics, reproductive factors, lifestyle habits, imaging examination, and clinicopathologic data were collected for patients. Chi‐square test and one‐way analysis of variance were used to compare the distributions of variables among the four breast cancer subtypes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals where luminal A patients served as the reference group. Overall, more commonality rather than heterogeneity on the distributions of factors was found between the four molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The proportion of overweight and obesity were lower in HER2‐enriched subtype. Women with age at menarche ≤13 years were more likely to be found in basal‐like subtype. Postmenopausal women were more frequent in HER2‐enriched and basal‐like subtypes. Women with benign breast disease and higher breast density were more common in HER2‐enriched subtype. Risk factor scoring showed that total risk scores were similar among the four subtypes. HER2‐enriched and basal‐like subtypes were more frequently diagnosed with large tumors. Calcification was more likely to be found in luminal B and HER2‐enriched subtypes, whereas less distributed in basal‐like subtype. Most of the breast cancer risk factors were similarly distributed among the four major breast cancer subtypes; commonality is predominant.",2019 Apr

This study investigated how breast arterial calcification (BAC) detected from routine mammography correlates with coronary artery calcification and aortic calcification. Materials and methods: A total of 404 female patients above 40 years of age who, within a 6-month period, had undergone thoracic computed tomography and mammography for various reasons were screened retrospectively at our clinic. Mammographies were assessed for BAC and thoracic CT investigations were assessed for CAC and AC. Patients included in the study were scored as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe) depending on the number and shape of CAC, AC, and BAC lesions observed. Results: Four hundred and four females were enrolled in the study. While BAC was detected in 123 patients, no BAC was observed in the other 281 patients. In the BAC-positive patients, the rates of CAC (45.5% vs. 19.9%, P < 0.001) and AC (67.5% vs. 32.4%, P < 0.001) were notably higher than in the BAC-negative patients.

336,Brown RB,"Dysregulated Phosphate Metabolism, Periodontal Disease, and Cancer: Possible Global Health Implications.","An association between periodontal disease and cancer has been established in recent studies, but no common etiology has been identified in the hopes of reducing the global burden of these non-communicable diseases. This perspective article hypothesizes that the determinant mediating the association of periodontal disease with cancer is dysregulated phosphate metabolism. Phosphate, an essential dietary micronutrient, is dysregulated in chronic kidney disease, and both cancer and periodontal disease are associated with chronic kidney disease. Reviewed evidence includes the association between phosphate toxicity and cancer development, and the association between periodontal disease and chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder includes conditions such as ectopic calcification and bone resorption, which may be indirectly related to periodontal disease. Dental calculus in periodontal disease contains calcium phosphate crystals that are deposited from excess calcium and phosphate in saliva. Alveolar bone resorption may be linked systemically to release of parathyroid hormone in response to hypocalcemia induced by hyperphosphatemia. More research is needed to examine the role of dysregulated phosphate metabolism in periodontal disease.",2019 Mar

FFDM and C-View images (n = 380) were independently evaluated by three readers through Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categorisation, breast density and lesion characterisation. Statistical analysis was done comparing sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of C-View + DBT with FFDM + DBT as standard of reference. Very good interreader agreement in BI-RADS category and density assessment between C-View + DBT and FFDM + DBT, with high sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of C-View + DBT when compared with FFDM + DBT. There was comparable PPV between C-View + DBT and FFDM + DBT, with histopathology as gold standard. High level of interreader agreement in BI-RADS category and density assessment for FFDM + DBT and C-View + DBT. There was good agreement between FFDM + DBT and C-View + DBT in mass characterization, and almost perfect agreement in calcification and asymmetric density. 52.2% lower radiation dose incurred when using C-View + DBT.

338,"Rustamov V,Keller F,Klicks J,Hafner M,Rudolf R","Bone Sialoprotein Shows Enhanced Expression in Early, High-Proliferation Stages of Three-Dimensional Spheroid Cell Cultures of Breast Cancer Cell Line MDA-MB-231.","Normally, bone sialoprotein (BSP) is an important contributor to bone micro-calcification. However, it is also highly expressed in bone-metastatic malignancies, including prostate, lung, and breast cancer. In these disorders, BSP correlates with poor prognosis. Its expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells is enhanced by the transcription factor RUNX2, and both, BSP and RUNX2 are under control of IGF-1 and TGFβ1. Knockdown of BSP or its inactivation by specific antibodies were found to reduce the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells in xenografts. While the role of BSP in bone metastasis was studied using such in vivo models, valid in vitro test systems to investigate BSP biology have been lacking since this protein is expressed at very low levels in classical 2D cell cultures and the frequently used breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 is difficult to grow in 3D. Here, we have developed a long-term 3D spheroid culture model using MDA-MB-231 cells in a sandwich approach using cell embedding between a non-adherent surface and basement membrane extracts. This allowed consistent growth of spheroids for more than 21 days. Also, co-culturing of MDA-MB-231 with CCD-1137Sk fibroblasts yielded stably growing spheroids, suggesting the importance of extracellular matrix (ECM) in this process. In addition, we have set up a novel and simple open source analysis tool to characterize protein expression in 2D cultures and spheroids by immunofluorescence. Using this approach in combination with Western blot analysis, the expression profile of BSP was analyzed. BSP was enriched at the rims of spheroids, both in mono- and co-cultures and its abundance in general correlated with that of TGFβ1 under different conditions, including spheroid maturation, cytostatic treatment, and fibroblast co-culture. Conversely, correlation of IGF-1 and BSP was limited to mono-culture time course profiles. In conclusion, we present novel tools to study the regulation of gene expression in combination with cell proliferation and apoptosis in a long-term 3D model of breast cancer and find dynamic abundance profiles of the metastasis-relevant protein BSP and its regulators.",2019
339,"Wasilewski GB,Vervloet MG,Schurgers LJ",The Bone—Vasculature Axis: Calcium Supplementation and the Role of Vitamin K.,"Calcium supplements are broadly prescribed to treat osteoporosis either as monotherapy or together with vitamin D to enhance calcium absorption. It is still unclear whether calcium supplementation significantly contributes to the reduction of bone fragility and fracture risk. Data suggest that supplementing post-menopausal women with high doses of calcium has a detrimental impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are prone to vascular calcification in part due to impaired phosphate excretion. Calcium-based phosphate binders further increase risk of vascular calcification progression. In both bone and vascular tissue, vitamin K-dependent processes play an important role in calcium homeostasis and it is tempting to speculate that vitamin K supplementation might protect from the potentially untoward effects of calcium supplementation. This review provides an update on current literature on calcium supplementation among post-menopausal women and CKD patients and discusses underlying molecular mechanisms of vascular calcification. We propose therapeutic strategies with vitamin K2 treatment to prevent or hold progression of vascular calcification as a consequence of excessive calcium intake.",2019

Although calcification may be an important sign of slow growth in meningiomas, the developmental process and its relation to the tumor growth pattern have not been elucidated. We retrospectively examined the location and degree of calcification in 150 meningiomas (131 asymptomatic tumors) using computed tomography (CT) scans and mean Hounsfield units (mHU). Tumor growth was evaluated using serial imaging studies wherein we calculated tumor doubling time (Td) and identified the growth curve pattern as exponential, intermediate, or decelerating. Tumors in women more frequently had calcification and showed higher mHU than those in men. The mHU was measured at least twice in 57 tumors. Tumors in women showed greater mHU increases than those in men. We found a significant correlation between Td and mHU (R = 0.49). Tumors in men and those in patients in the younger age group grew significantly faster. Multivariate analysis revealed that mHU was the only significant factor affecting Td (P <0.0001). The growth pattern was significantly related to calcification (n = 61, P = 0.0042). Tumors with decelerating growth more frequently showed calcification and had higher mHU than those with exponential growth. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that mHU was a better predictor of growth pattern change compared with calcification on CT scan. Meningiomas with high mHU, even without calcification, were likely to show growth deceleration. Mean Hounsfield unit correlated with Td and may be a good quantitative indicator of the growth rate and pattern.",2019 Feb
343,"Horvat JV,Keating DM,Rodrigues-Duarte H,Morris EA,Mango VL",Calcifications at Digital Breast Tomosynthesis: Imaging Features and Biopsy Techniques.,"Full-field digital mammography (FFDM), the standard of care for breast cancer screening, has some limitations. With the advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), improvements including decreased recall rates and increased cancer detection rates have been observed. The quasi–three-dimensional capability of DBT reduces breast tissue overlap, a significant limitation of FFDM. However, early studies demonstrate that a few cancers detected at FFDM may not be diagnosed at DBT-only screening, and lesions with calcifications as the dominant feature may look less suspicious at DBT or not be visible at all. These findings support the use of combined FFDM and DBT protocols to optimize screening performance. However, this combination would approximately double the patient’s radiation exposure. The development of computer algorithms that generate two-dimensional synthesized mammography (SM) views from DBT has improved calcification conspicuity and sensitivity. Therefore, SM may substitute for FFDM in screening protocols, reducing radiation exposure. DBT plus SM demonstrates significantly better performance than that of FFDM alone, although there are reports of missed malignant calcifications. Thus, some centers continue to perform FFDM with DBT. Use of DBT in breast imaging has also necessitated the development of DBT-guided biopsy. DBT-guided biopsy may have a higher success rate than that of stereotactic biopsy, with a shorter procedure time. While DBT brings substantial improvements to breast cancer imaging, it is important to be aware of its strengths and limitations regarding detection of calcifications.

The 2nd patient experienced dizziness, neck pain, and seizure. Computed tomography (CT) was used for the diagnosis of brain metastasis because he was inserted a pacemaker. Diagnosis:: In case 1, brain MRI revealed that a solitary brain metastasis 14-mm in size was identified at the cortico-medullary junction in the left frontal lobe.

Times to develop central nervous system metastasis were 19 months and 33 months, respectively. Interventions:: The 1st patient was treated with 45.2 Gy γ-knife irradiation for the solitary brain metastasis, and the 2nd patient was treated with supportive care due to the poor general condition. Outcomes:: The prognoses of these 2 patients were 13 months, and 32 days from the diagnosis of brain metastasis. The 1st patient did not experience complication of a γ-knife irradiation and brain metastasis was controlled until death.

However, the precise mechanism by which they form remains incompletely understood. Following development of an in vitro model using human breast cancer cells lines cultured with a combination of mineralisation-promoting reagents, analysis of calcium deposition, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and changes in expression of key genes was used to monitor the calcification process. Two cell lines were identified as successfully mineralising in vitro, MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3. Mineralising cell lines displayed higher levels of ALP activity that was further increased by addition of mineralisation promoting media. qPCR analysis revealed changes in expression of both pro- (RUNX2) and anti- (MGP, ENPP1) mineralisation genes. Mineralisation was suppressed by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ and inhibition of TRPM7, demonstrating a functional role for the channel in formation of microcalcifications. Increased Mg2+ was also found to effectively reduce calcium deposition. These results expand the number of human breast cancer cell lines with a demonstrated in vitro mineralisation capability, provide further evidence for the role of an active, cellular process of microcalcification formation and demonstrate for the first time a role for TRPM7 mediated Ca2+ transport.",2019

ER stress, especially the ATF4-mediated pathway, has also been shown to be significantly upregulated in calcific AV disease. Since elevated cyclic stretch is one of the major mechanical stimuli for AV calcification and ATF4 is a validated target of miR-214, we investigated the effect of cyclic stretch on miR-214 expression as well as those of ATF4 and two downstream genes (CHOP and BCL2L1). Porcine aortic valve (PAV) leaflets were cyclically stretched at 15% for 48 hours in regular medium and for one week in osteogenic medium to simulate the early remodeling and late calcification stages of stretch-induced AV disease, respectively. For both stages, 10% cyclic stretch served as the physiological counterpart. RT-qPCR revealed that miR-214 expression was significantly downregulated during the late calcification stage, whereas the mRNA expression of ATF4 and BCL2L1 was upregulated and downregulated, respectively, during both early remodeling and late calcification stages. When PAV leaflets were statically transfected with miR-214 mimic in osteogenic medium for 2 weeks, calcification was significantly reduced compared to the control mimic case. This implies that miR-214 may have a protective role in stretchinduced calcific AV disease.",2019 Apr

Methods: We prospectively enrolled women with no prior cardiovascular disease aged 60 to 79 years undergoing mammography screening at Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 10/24/2012 and 2/13/2015. Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR), along with specific laboratory, demographic, and medical data, were measured at the baseline visit. Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), medication history, and other comorbidities were identified from self-report and/or electronic medical records. BAC presence and gradation (mass) was measured by digital quantification of full-field mammograms. Results: Among 3,507 participants, 24.5% were aged ≥70 years, 63.5% were white, 7.5% had eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2, with 85.7% having uACR ≥30 mg/g and 3.3% having uACR ≥300 mg/g. The prevalence of any measured BAC (>0 mg) was 27.9%. Neither uACR ≥30 mg/g nor uACR ≥300 were significantly associated with BAC in crude or multivariable analyses.

Vascular calcification is a risk factor for ischemic vascular disorders and slowing calcification may reduce mortality in affected patients. The absence of early biomarkers hampers the identification of patients at risk. EndMT and vascular calcification are induced upon cooperation between distinct stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines and transforming growth factor beta (TGF‐β) family members. However, how these signaling pathways interplay to promote cell differentiation and eventually vascular calcification is not well understood. Using in vitro and ex vivo analysis in animal models and patient‐derived tissues, we have identified that the pro‐inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐α) and interleukin‐1 beta (IL‐1β) induce EndMT in human primary aortic endothelial cells, thereby sensitizing them for BMP‐9‐induced osteogenic differentiation. Downregulation of the BMP type II receptor BMPR2 is a key event in this process. Rather than compromising BMP canonical signal transduction, loss of BMPR2 results in decreased JNK signaling in ECs, thus enhancing BMP‐9‐induced mineralization. Altogether, our results point at the BMPR2–JNK signaling axis as a key pathway regulating inflammation‐induced EndMT and contributing to calcification. © 2018 The Authors.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical value of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in diagnosing molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The present study retrospectively analyzed 134 cases of breast cancer with data regarding surgery, complete pathology and immunohistochemistry, which were collected at The Second Clinical College of Fujian Medical University (Quanzhou, China) between May 2013 and October 2014. The patients were divided into the four following molecular subtypes: Luminal A, luminal B, triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) overexpression, according to the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone hormone receptor, HER-2 and Ki67. The association between clinical characteristics of each molecular subtype and characteristics of DBT were assessed. Calcification scores and lymph node size were the indicators that exhibited a significant difference following comparison between the four molecular subtypes. The subgroup analysis based on tumor size, calcification scores and lymph node size identified a significant difference in the distribution between patients with breast cancer with lymph node size of ≥1.5 and <1.5 cm. The analysis also revealed that the molecular subtypes of breast cancer were significantly associated with variables of calcification scores and lymph node size.

One patient with a large lesion (10.7 cm) showed chest wall adhesion. On contrast-enhanced CT images, all lesions demonstrated slight inhomogeneous enhancement ≤14 HU. Conclusion: CT is the reference standard diagnostic technique for locating pulmonary chondroma. In most cases, CT findings show some characteristics that are important in the diagnosis, surgical planning, and follow-up of the tumour.",2018
353,"Cruz-Bernal A,Flores-Barranco MM,Almanza-Ojeda DL,Ledesma S,Ibarra-Manzano MA",Analysis of the Cluster Prominence Feature for Detecting Calcifications in Mammograms.,"In mammograms, a calcification is represented as small but brilliant white region of the digital image. Earlier detection of malignant calcifications in patients provides high expectation of surviving to this disease. Nevertheless, white regions are difficult to see by visual inspection because a mammogram is a gray-scale image of the breast. To help radiologists in detecting abnormal calcification, computer-inspection methods of mammograms have been proposed; however, it remains an open important issue. In this context, we propose a strategy for detecting calcifications in mammograms based on the analysis of the cluster prominence (cp) feature histogram. The highest frequencies of the cp histogram describe the calcifications on the mammography. Therefore, we obtain a function that models the behaviour of the cp histogram using the Vandermonde interpolation twice. The first interpolation yields a global representation, and the second models the highest frequencies of the histogram. A weak classifier is used for obtaining a final classification of the mammography, that is, with or without calcifications. Experimental results are compared with real DICOM images and their corresponding diagnosis provided by expert radiologists, showing that the cp feature is highly discriminative.",2018

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a series of ADH lesions and assessed whether the morphological parameters of the biopsy materials indicated whether the patient should undergo surgery. A total of 207 breast biopsies [56 core needle biopsies (CNBs) and 151 vacuum-assisted biopsies (VABs)] histologically diagnosed as ADH were analyzed retrospectively, together with subsequently obtained surgical specimens. All histological slides were re-analyzed with regard to the presence/absence of ADH-associated calcification, other B3 lesions (lesion of uncertain malignant potential), extent of the lesion, and the presence of multifocality. Results: The overall underestimation rate for the whole cohort was 39% (57% for CNB, 33% for VAB). In the univariate analysis, the method of biopsy (CNB vs VAB, p = 0.002) and presence of multifocality in VAB specimens (p = 0.0176) were significant risk factors for the underestimation of the disease (ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer detected on subsequent open biopsy). In the multivariate logistic regression model, the absence of calcification (p = 0.0252) and the presence of multifocality (unifocal vs multifocal ADH, p = 0.0147) in VAB specimens were significant risk factors for underestimation. Conclusions: Multifocal ADH without associated calcification diagnosed by CNB tends to have a higher upgrade rate. Because the upgrade rate was 16.5% even in the group with the lowest risk (VAB-diagnosed unifocal ADH with calcification), we could not identify a subgroup that would not require an open biopsy.",2019

Previous studies have determined the individual therapeutic efficacies of hyaluronic acid (HA) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on OA; however, the underlying mechanism is still lacking. Therefore, we investigated mechanistic approach of HA+PRP therapy on chondrocyte apoptosis in IL-1β+TNF-α (I+T) treated in vitro OA model, in addition to in vivo anterior cruciate ligament transection-OA mice model. MTT assay showed an enhanced chondrocyte proliferation and viability in HA+PRP-treated group, compared to I+T, I+T/HA, I+T/PRP, I+T/HA+PRP groups. Further, HA+PRP also significantly suppressed ROS, apoptotic cleaved caspase-3 and PARP, p53 and p21 and MMP-1; whereas, cell cycle modulatory proteins including p-ERK, cyclin B1, D1, and E2 were upregulated. The sub-G1 population and TUNEL assay confirmed the higher abundance of healthy chondrocytes in HA+PRP group. A significantly decreased ARS staining in HA+PRP group was also noted, indicating reduced cartilaginous matrix mineralization compared to other groups. Conclusively, compared to HA or PRP, the combined HA+PRP might be a promising therapy for articular cartilage regeneration in osteoarthritic pathology, possibly via augmented anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative chondrocyte proliferation and inhibited MMP-1 activity and matrix calcification.",2018 Dec
356,"Blaser MC,Aikawa E",Roles and Regulation of Extracellular Vesicles in Cardiovascular Mineral Metabolism.,"Cardiovascular calcification is a multifaceted disease that is a leading independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have identified a calcification-prone population of extracellular vesicles as the putative elementary units of vascular microcalcification in diseased heart valves and vessels. Their action is highly context-dependent; extracellular vesicles released by smooth muscle cells, valvular interstitial cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages may promote or inhibit mineralization, depending on the phenotype of their originating cells and/or the extracellular environment to which they are released. In particular, emerging roles for vesicular microRNAs, bioactive lipids, metabolites, and protein cargoes in driving this pro-calcific switch underpin the necessity of innovative strategies to employ next-generation sequencing and omics technologies in order to better understand the pathobiology of these nano-sized entities. Furthermore, a recent body of work has emerged that centers on the novel re-purposing of extracellular vesicles and exosomes as potential therapeutic avenues for cardiovascular calcification. This review aims to highlight the role of extracellular vesicles as constituents of cardiovascular calcification and summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the biophysical nature of vesicle accumulation, aggregation, and mineralization. We also comprehensively discuss the latest evidence that extracellular vesicles act as key mediators and regulators of cell/cell communication, osteoblastic/osteoclastic differentiation, and cell/matrix interactions in cardiovascular tissues. Lastly, we highlight the importance of robust vesicle isolation and characterization when studying these phenomena, and offer a brief primer on working with cardiovascular applications of extracellular vesicles.",2018

However, interscan variability of CAC quantification is high, especially in scans made without ECG synchronization. We propose a method for automatic detection of CACs that are severely affected by cardiac motion. Subsequently, we evaluate the impact of such CACs on CAC quantification and CVD risk determination. This study includes 1000 baseline and 585 one-year follow-up low-dose chest CTs from the National Lung Screening Trial. About 415 baseline scans are used to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network that identifies observer determined CACs affected by severe motion artifacts. Therefore, 585 paired scans acquired at baseline and follow-up were used to evaluate the impact of severe motion artifacts on CAC quantification and risk categorization. Based on the CAC amount, the scans were categorized into four standard CVD risk categories. The method identified CACs affected by severe motion artifacts with 85.2% accuracy. Moreover, reproducibility of CAC scores in scan pairs is higher in scans containing mostly CACs not affected by severe cardiac motion. Hence, the proposed method enables identification of scans affected by severe cardiac motion, where CAC quantification may not be reproducible.",2018 Oct
358,"Fathala AL,Alabdulkarim FM,Shoukri M,Alanazi M",Association between breast arterial calcifications found on mammography and coronary artery calcifications in asymptomatic Saudi women.,"BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no data on the prevalence of breast arterial calcification (BAC) in Saudi women. Furthermore, there are no data on the relationship between BAC and coronary artery calcium score (CACS) as a coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factor in Saudi women who undergo mammography. OBJECTIVE: Examine the role of BAC as a potential female-specific risk factor for CAD in Saudi women in order to investigate the relationship between BAC and CACS in women who undergo a screening mammography, and study the relationship between BAC and CAD risk factors, including age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), dyslipidemia, and family history of CAD. DESIGN: Retrospective, medical records review. SETTING: Single tertiary care center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study cohort included women who had mammograms and a CACS scan, and for whom data on CAD risk stratification and CAD risk factors had been collected within one year of each other from 2014 to 2017. Women with CAD were excluded from the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Breast arterial calcification as a marker for coronary artery disease. SAMPLE SIZE: 307 Saudi women. RESULTS: BAC was found in 142 (46%) patients in the study population. BAC+ women were significantly older than the BAC− women (P=.001), and a strong association was found between BAC and CACS (P=.0001), diabetes (P=.0001), hypertension (P=.021), and CKD (P=.0031). However, no association was found between BAC and tobacco smoking, dyslipidemia, and family history of CAD. In addition, a strong correlation was found between CACS and the components of the BAC score (P<.001). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that age, CAC, and CKD are the only strong predictors of BAC. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of BAC in Saudi women is 46%, and there may be a strong association between BAC and CAC, age, hypertension, and CKD. A large-scale prospective research study is necessary to validate the role of BAC on screening mammography as a CAD risk stratification tool and before routine reporting of BAC on a mammography report. LIMITATIONS: Because this was a retrospective study, patient selection bias cannot be excluded.",2018 Nov-Dec
359,"Chen Y,Lowengrub JS",Tumor growth and calcification in evolving microenvironmental geometries.,"In this paper, we apply the diffuse domain framework developed in Chen and Lowengrub (Tumor growth in complex, evolving microenvironmental geometries: A diffuse domain approach, J. Theor. Biol. 361 (2014) 14–30) to study the effects of a deformable basement membrane (BM) on the growth of a tumor in a confined, ductal geometry, such as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We use a continuum model of tumor microcalcification and investigate the tumor extent beyond the microcalcification. In order to solve the governing equations efficiently, we develop a stable nonlinear multigrid finite difference method. Two dimensional simulations are performed where the adhesion between tumor cells and the basement membrane is varied. Additional simulations considering the variation of duct radius and membrane stiffness are also conducted. The results demonstrate that enhanced membrane deformability promotes tumor growth and tumor calcification. When the duct radius is small, the cell-BM adhesion is weak or when the membrane is slightly deformed, the mammographic and pathologic tumor extents are linearly correlated, as predicted by Macklin et al. (J. Theor. Biol. 301 (2012) 122–140) using an agent-based model that does not account for the deformability of the basement membrane and the active forces that the membrane imparts on the tumor cells. Interestingly, we predict that when the duct radius is large, there is strong cell-BM adhesion or the membrane is highly deformed, the extents of the mammographic and pathologic tumors are instead quadratically correlated. The simulations can help surgeons to measure DCIS surgical margins while removing less non-cancerous tissue, and can improve targeting of intra- and post-operative radiotherapy.",2019 Feb 21

The SGK1 protein is activated by a signaling cascade involving phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). SGK1 up-regulates Na+/K+-ATPase, a variety of carriers including Na+-,K+-,2Cl−- cotransporter (NKCC), NaCl cotransporter (NCC), Na+/H+ exchangers, diverse amino acid transporters and several glucose carriers such as Na+-coupled glucose transporter SGLT1. SGK1 further up-regulates a large number of ion channels including epithelial Na+ channel ENaC, voltagegated Na+ channel SCN5A, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channel (ORAI1) with its stimulator STIM1, epithelial Ca2+ channels TRPV5 and TRPV6 and diverse K+ channels. Furthermore, SGK1 influences transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), p53 tumor suppressor protein, cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB), activator protein-1 (AP-1) and forkhead box O3 protein (FOXO3a). Thus, SGK1 supports cellular glucose uptake and glycolysis, angiogenesis, cell survival, cell migration, and wound healing. Presumably as last line of defense against tissue injury, SGK1 fosters tissue fibrosis and tissue calcification replacing energy consuming cells.",0
361,"Tintut Y,Hsu JJ,Demer LL",Lipoproteins in Cardiovascular Calcification: Potential Targets and Challenges.,"Previously considered a degenerative process, cardiovascular calcification is now established as an active process that is regulated in several ways by lipids, phospholipids, and lipoproteins. These compounds serve many of the same functions in vascular and valvular calcification as they do in skeletal bone calcification. Hyperlipidemia leads to accumulation of lipoproteins in the subendothelial space of cardiovascular tissues, which leads to formation of mildly oxidized phospholipids, which are known bioactive factors in vascular cell calcification. One lipoprotein of particular interest is Lp(a), which showed genome-wide significance for the presence of aortic valve calcification and stenosis. It carries an important enzyme, autotaxin, which produces lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and thus has a key role in inflammation among other functions. Matrix vesicles, extruded from the plasma membrane of cells, are the sites of initiation of mineral formation. Phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid in the membranes of matrix vesicles, is believed to complex with calcium and phosphate ions, creating a nidus for hydroxyapatite crystal formation in cardiovascular as well as in skeletal bone mineralization. This review focuses on the contributions of lipids, phospholipids, lipoproteins, and autotaxin in cardiovascular calcification, and discusses possible therapeutic targets.",2018

An association of Cushing syndrome with CNSET has drawn attention, but the origin of CNSET has not been clarified. Case presentation: We report here the case of a 20-year-old male with Klinefelter syndrome who underwent liver resection for an increasing liver tumor that was pathologically diagnosed with CNSET. He was postoperatively followed up and received several examinations, and recurrences and extrahepatic lymph node metastases were detected on the 64th day after surgery. Chemoembolization and chemotherapy were not effective, leading to tumor progression with development of progressive liver failure, and the patient finally died 164 days after hepatectomy. Conclusions: This case suggests that an imbalance of hormones affects the genesis and progression of CNSET, and indicates the importance of closely following patients with CNSET by imaging with attention to hepatic recurrence and extrahepatic metastases.",2018

Background: BAC is an emerging risk marker of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods:: MINERVA (MultIethNic study of brEast aRterial calcium gradation and cardioVAscular disease) is a cohort of women aged 60 to 79 at baseline (10/24/2012 - 2/13/2015) who were free of symptomatic CVD at baseline. The analytical sample comprised 3,800 women with available ABI, BAC assessment and covariates. We performed cross-sectional logistic regression analysis. Results:: 203 women (5.3%) had an ABI < 0.90 indicative of PAD, 26 (0.7%) had an ABI > 1.3 and 94% (n=3,571) had an ABI within normal limits. After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, LDL-C, HDL-C, hs-CRP, estimated-GFR, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, serum calcium, serum vitamin D and serum PTH, BAC presence remained significantly associated with ABI < 0.90 (OR=1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.87; p=0.04). After further adjustment for menopausal hormone therapy, parity and history of breast feeding, the association became marginally significant (OR=1.36; 95% CI, 0.99-1.85; p=0.05). No clear pattern of association was observed for increased gradation of BAC and ABI<0.9, and no significant associations were noted between BAC presence vs. absence or BAC gradation with ABI > 1.3. Conclusions:: Among asymptomatic postmenopausal women, presence of BAC was associated with PAD independently of traditional risk factors. Additional prospective studies are required to establish the value of BAC for prediction of incident PAD in the general population.",2018 Nov

These nonpalpable microcalcifications with specific features in breast tissues are clinically considered an early indicator of breast carcinoma. Our goal in this study was to develop a murine breast microcalcification model for optimizing in vivo imaging. Recombinant human BMP-2 was expressed in E. coli, and the purified bioactive protein was used as inducing factor for the production of breast microcalcifications in a murine animal model. Syngeneic breast tumors were obtained by injection of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells with Matrigel into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice. Different doses of bioactive rhBMP-2 were administered either as single or multiple intraperitoneal injections or directly into tumor on a weekly basis. Three weeks after the first injection of rhBMP-2, the microcalcification of breast tumor was detected by microcomputed tomography followed by intravenous injection of radiotracer [18F] Sodium fluoride for positron emission tomography imaging. Our findings indicate that rhBMP-2 induced microcalcifications of breast tumor by both systemic and direct injection of rhBMP-2 into tumors in a dose-dependent manner. Although little is known about the molecular mechanism of microcalcification, here we report a new murine model of human breast tumor induced microcalcification by rhBMP-2 to optimize in vivo imaging methods and to study the role of BMP-2 as a mediator of pathological mineralization and bone-like microcalcification formation in breast tumor. This BMP-2-induced microcalcification model may allow us to discriminate the type of microcalcification in tumors and to perform quantitative analysis on the calcification as a new detection strategy for early identification of pathological mineralization of breast tissues in women.",2018
365,"Chellan B,Sutton NR,Hofmann Bowman MA",S100/RAGE-Mediated Inflammation and Modified Cholesterol Lipoproteins as Mediators of Osteoblastic Differentiation of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells.,"Arterial calcification is a feature of atherosclerosis and shares many risk factors including diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and age. Although there is overlap in risk factors, anti-atherosclerotic therapies, including statins, fail to reduce arterial, and aortic valve calcifications. This suggests that low density lipoprotein (LDL) may not be the main driver for aortic valve disease and arterial calcification. This review focuses on modified LDLs and their role in mediating foam cell formation in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), with special emphasis on enzyme modified non-oxidized LDL (ELDL). In vivo, ELDL represents one of the many forms of modified LDLs present in the atherosclerotic vessel. Phenotypic changes of macrophages and SMCs brought about by the uptake of modified LDLs overlap significantly in an atherosclerotic milieu, making it practically impossible to differentiate between the effects from oxidized LDL, ELDL, and other LDL modification. By studying in vitro-generated modifications of LDL, we were able to demonstrate marked differences in the transcriptome of human coronary artery SMCs (HCASMCs) upon uptake of ELDL, OxLDL, and native LDL, indicating that specific modifications of LDL in atherosclerotic plaques may determine the biology and functional consequences in vasculature. Enzyme-modified non-oxidized LDL (ELDL) induces calcification of SMCs and this is associated with reduced mRNA levels for genes protective for calcification (ENPP1, MGP) and upregulation of osteoblastic genes. A second focus of this review is on the synergy between hyperlipidemia and accelerated calcification In vivo in a mouse models with transgenic expression of human S100A12.

366,Takahashi K,Diagnosis of an extremely rare pleomorphic adenoma of the breast with core needle biopsy: A case report.,"Introduction: Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) rarely originates in the mammary gland. This tumor is a benign mixed tumor and is commonly found in the salivary glands, but rarely shows findings similar to those of breast cancer. The tumor is misdiagnosed in 30–50% of the patients, including overdiagnosis of malignancy preoperatively, leading to unnecessary surgery for breast cancer. Case presentation: The present patient was a 45-year-old woman who exhibited no subjective symptoms. She visited the Takahashi Breast and Gastroenterology Clinic for breast cancer screening. A mass measuring 1.5 cm was palpated in the E region of the left breast. Mammography (MMG) showed a tumor shadow in the left S region. There was a high-density area inside the tumor, suggesting bone or cartilage formation, and a diagnosis of category 3 on MMG was made. Ultrasonography (US) revealed a poorly demarcated tumor measuring 14.3 × 14.8 × 10.7 mm with relatively smooth margins and inhomogeneous high-echo content. Core needle biopsy (CNB) was performed, which led to the diagnosis of PA. The tumor showed proliferation of small cells forming glandular duct-like structures or anastomosed funicular structures. Moreover, the cells in the basilar portion were spindle shaped and transitioned to the stroma. Cartilaginous metaplasia, calcification, and ossification were observed in some areas. Intraductal papilloma was also observed in some areas. Conclusion: PA may be diagnosed based on the histological findings of CNB. Thus, unnecessary surgery for breast cancer may be avoided.",2018 Dec

Methods:: The study was conducted from September 2013 to July 2014. A total of 66 women with BAC and 66 age-matched controls without BAC were analyzed. The groups were compared with respect to demographics, clinical, reproductive, laboratory parameters, and 10-year fatal CVD risk. Results:: The mean ages of the women in the study was 54.0 years (40-85 years). Hypertension, systolic blood pressure, levels of serum total cholesterol and the calculated SCORE risk were higher in the BAC (+) group than in the BAC (-) group (p=0.04, p=0.031, p=0.046, and p=0.038 respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that none of them was independent factor of BAC on mammograms, only the 10-year fatal CVD risk was close to being statistically significant (OR:1.17, CI:0.98-1.38, p=0.06). Conclusion:: BAC on mammography was found to be related to the 10-year fatal CVD risk as calculated by the SCORE risk score system. Additional large-scale prospective studies are required to further assess whether BAC can be considered a useful screening tool for CVD risk prediction in women who screened for breast cancer by mammography.",2018 Nov-Dec

Methods:: A total of 907 patients with 907 lesions were included retrospectively in this study. Traditional ultrasound and shear-wave elastography imaging were both performed. Patients age, maximum diameter, depth, distance, echogenicity, shape, boundary, margin, internal components, CDFI, calcification, echogenicity attenuation and longitudinal growth of lesions were observed and calculated by both univariate and multivariate analyses. Results:: Univariate analyses indicated that the age, depth, shape, margin, internal components, CDFI, calcification and pathology showed significant difference between the benign lesions with and without a “stiff rim”, whereas there was no correlation of ""stiff rim” with maximum diameter, distance, boundary, echogenicity, echo attenuation and longitudinal growth of the lesions. Multivariate analysis expressed that CDFI, margin, internal components, depth and age were significantly associated with the ""stiff rim"" sign in breast benign lesions, whereas there was no correlation with the pathology, shape or calcification of the lesions. Conclusions:: The “stiff rim” sign can be helpful for differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. Older patients with a “stiff rim” sign whose benign masses are deep, poorly defined, heterogeneous and have a positive CDFI should be examined more closely to avoid unnecessary false-positives. Advances in knowledge:: The “stiff rim” sign can be helpful for differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. Positive CDFI, poorly defined margin, heterogeneous internal components, deep depth and older age were significantly associated with the “stiff rim” sign in benign breast lesions.",2019 Feb

However, current imaging methods to identify vascular calcification have limitations in determining plaque composition and structure. Nanoparticles can overcome these limitations due to their versatility and ability to incorporate a wide range of targeting and contrast agents.

Despite its high specificity and sensitivity, false-positive I-131 uptake could be seen on whole body scan (WBS) that may lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary radioiodine treatment. In this study, we aimed to present the I-131 WBS and concomitant single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) images of unexpected false-positive radioiodine uptake along with the patients’ clinical outcomes and the contribution of SPECT/CT imaging. Methods:: I-131 WBSs of 1507 patients with DTC were retrospectively reviewed, and anticipated I-131 uptakes (like in breasts or thymus) were excluded from the study. The unexpected false-positive I-131 uptakes with concomitant SPECT/CT imaging were included in the study. Results:: Twenty-one patients had 23 unexpected I-131 uptakes on WBS and concomitant SPECT/CT imaging. The vast majority (87%) of these cases were seen on post-therapeutic I-131 WBS. Most of the false-positive I-131 uptakes could be explained by SPECT/CT and radiologic findings, and were secondary to non-thyroid conditions (bronchiectasis, lung infection, subcutaneous injection into gluteal fatty tissue, aortic calcification, benign bone cyst, vertebral hemangioma, recent non-thyroid surgical procedure site, rotator cuff injury, mature cystic teratoma and ovarian follicle cyst). However, the possible reasons of 9 false-positive I-131 uptakes could not be explained by radiologic findings. Conclusion:: We suggest that false-positive I-131 uptake and its underlying mechanisms (inflammation, trapping, increased perfusion, etc.) must be kept in mind in patients with thyroid cancer and unexpected findings must be considered together with serum thyroglobulin levels, SPECT/CT and radiologic findings in order to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary radioiodine treatment.",2018 Oct
373,"Narayan AK,Keating DM,Morris EA,Mango VL",Calling All Calcifications: A Retrospective Case Control Study.,"Introduction: The majority of recalls from screening mammography do not result in biopsy recommendation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if calcifications recalled from screening mammography are more likely to result in biopsy recommendations than other findings. Methods: IRB-approved electronic medical record search was performed to obtain a random sample of screening mammograms assigned BI-RADS 0 assessment during 2014–2015. Primary reason for recall was classified as mass, asymmetry, focal asymmetry, calcifications, or distortion. Primary outcome was biopsy performed after diagnostic work-up. Secondary outcome was proportion of biopsies performed that were positive for cancer, positive predictive value 3(PPV3). Logistic regression was used to compare reasons for recall (calcifications vs other findings) with biopsy recommendation proportions. Results: Random database sampling yielded 402 screening examinations with BI-RADS 0 assessments with 449 total findings. Reasons for recall included calcifications (14.0%, 63/449), masses (15.8%, 71/449), asymmetries (50.8%, 228/449), focal asymmetries (14.3%, 64/449) and architectural distortions (5.1%, 23/449). Overall, 21.6% of recalls led to image-guided biopsy (87/402). Recalls for calcifications were more likely to result in biopsy compared with other types of findings (Adjusted OR 8.56, 95% CI 4.58 to 16.0, p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were found in PPV3 proportions between calcification and non-calcification findings (p = 0.812). Conclusion: Recalls for calcifications are much more likely to undergo biopsy compared with other findings. Increased biopsy rates for calcifications should be considered when recalling a patient from mammography screening in the context of practice specific positive predictive values and cancer detection rates.",2019 Jan-Feb

375,"Ferreira LB,Lima RT,Bastos ACSda F,Silva AM,Tavares C,Pestana A,Rios E,Eloy C,Sobrinho-Simões M,Gimba ERP,Soares P",OPNa Overexpression Is Associated with Matrix Calcification in Thyroid Cancer Cell Lines.,"Osteopontin (OPN) spliced variants (OPN-SV: OPNa, OPNb, and OPNc) are aberrantly expressed in tumors and frequently associated with cancer progression. This holds true for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), which is the most common type of thyroid cancer (TC). PTC often presents with desmoplasia and dystrophic calcification, including psammoma bodies (PB). This work aimed to investigate total OPN (tOPN) and OPN-SV expression and their association with the presence of PB in the PTC classical variants (cPTC), as well as the involvement of OPN-SV in matrix calcification of TC cell lines. We found that cPTC samples presenting PB showed higher OPN expression levels. In TC cell lines, OPNa overexpression promotes higher matrix calcification and collagen synthesis when compared to that of clones overexpressing OPNb or OPNc. In response to OPN knockdown, calcification was inhibited, paralleled with the downregulation of calcification markers. In conclusion, our data evidenced that OPN expression is associated with the presence of PB in cPTC samples. Among the OPN-SV, OPNa is the main contributor to matrix calcification in tested TC cells, providing clues to a better understanding on the biology and ethiopathogenesis of the calcification process in TC cells.",2018 Oct

Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a secreted, non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein involved in inhibition of tissue calcification. Recently, MGP expression was related to cellular differentiation and tumor progression. A detailed MGP expression analysis in sensitive (A2780) and resistant to paclitaxel (PAC) (A2780PR) and topotecan (TOP) (A2780TR) ovarian cancer cell lines and their corresponding media was performed. MGP mRNA level (real time PCR analysis) and protein expression in cell lysates and cell culture medium (Western blot analysis) and protein expression in cancer cells (immunofluorescence analysis) and cancer patient lesions (immunohistochemistry) were determined in this study. We observed increased expression of MGP in PAC and TOP resistant cell lines at both mRNA and protein level. MGP protein was also detected in the corresponding culture media. Finally, we detected expression of MGP protein in ovarian cancer lesions from different histological type of cancer. MGP is an important factor that might contribute to cancer resistance mechanism by augmenting the interaction of cells with ECM components leading to increased resistance of ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel and topotecan. Expression found in ovarian cancer tissue suggests its possible role in ovarian cancer pathogenesis.",2018 Oct
377,"Jackson AO,Regine MA,Subrata C,Long S",Molecular mechanisms and genetic regulation in atherosclerosis.,"Atherosclerosis (AS) manifested by lipid accumulation, extracellular matrix protein deposition, and calcification in the intima and media of the large to medium size arteries promoting arterial stiffness and reduction of elasticity. It has been accepted that AS leads to increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent studies indicated that genetic abnormalities play an important role in the development of AS. Specific genetic mutation and histone modification have been found to induce AS formation. Furthermore, specific RNAs such as microRNAs and circular RNAs have been identified to play a crucial role in the progression of AS. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which genetic mutation, DNA and histone modification, microRNAs and circular RNA induce AS still remain elusive. This review describes specific mechanisms and pathways through which genetic mutation, DNA and histone modification, microRNAs and circular RNA instigate AS. This review further provides a therapeutic strategic direction for the treatment of AS targeting genetic mechanisms.",2018 Dec
378,"Suh JW,Yun BL",Breast Arterial Calcification: A Potential Surrogate Marker for Cardiovascular Disease.,"Breast arterial calcifications (BAC), frequently observed on screening mammography, have been considered as an incidental finding without increased risk for breast cancer. They are medial calcifications and therefore, are indicative of arteriosclerosis. Previous studies indicated that the risk factors of BAC partly overlap with those of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and the presence of BAC is associated with prevalent and incident CVD. This suggests that medial arterial calcification might contribute to CVD through a pathway distinct from the intimal atherosclerotic process. A recent study showed that the presence and severity of BAC are associated with the presence of coronary artery calcification or plaques on coronary computed tomography angiography in asymptomatic women aged more than 40 years. In addition, BAC provided an independent and incremental predictive value over conventional risk factors. Given that population-based mammography screening is currently recommended in asymptomatic women, the evaluation of BAC may be helpful in identifying high-risk women without additional cost or radiation exposure.",2018 Sep

Methods: Eighty-nine breast lesions were confirmed to have BC by ultrasound, surgery and pathology. According to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System classification method published by the American College of Radiology, six groups were created: spiculation and non-Burr sign; calcification and non-calcification; vascular anomaly syndrome and non-vascular anomaly syndrome; lymph node metastasis (LNM) and non-LNM. In each case, the expression of VEGF, COX-2 and MMP-9 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: Expression of VEGF, COX-2 and MMP-9 was higher in BC patients with the Burr sign than in those without it (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in expression of VEGF, COX-2, and MMP-9 between the calcification group and non-calcification group of BC patients (P>0.05). Expression of VEGF, COX-2, and MMP-9 was higher in those with vascular abnormalities than in those without them (P<0.05), as well as in the LNM group compared with the non-LNM group (P<0.05). Conclusions: The high expression of VEGF, COX-2, and MMP-9 could have an influence on the Burr sign, abnormal blood vessels, and LNM in BC patients using ultrasound.",2018

This study aimed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of USE with thyroid ultrasonography (USG) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) as preoperative predictor of malignancy, using postoperative histopathology as gold standard. Materials and Methods:: Consecutive patients with thyroid swelling/goiter underwent thyroid USG followed by USE. Patients with pure cystic nodules or eggshell calcification were excluded. Patients with nodules >10 mm with one or more high-risk USG features underwent FNA. Patients with no USG high-risk features, benign score on USE, and benign FNA were conservatively followed. All other patients underwent thyroidectomy. Results:: 246 consecutive patients underwent USG. Data from 97 patients (117 nodules) were analyzed. Median age of patients was 43 years with 85.4% females. All patients with USE score-1 had benign USG and FNA characteristics. Of 86 nodules having USE score-2, 18.6% nodules were hypoechoic and 16.28% had microcalcification. Hypoechogenicity and microcalcifications were observed in 66.67% nodules with USE score-3. All nodules with USE score-4 and 5 were hypoechoic and had microcalcifications. Histopathology was benign in 84 and malignant in 33 patients. Occurrence of malignancy in USE scores 1–5 was 0, 4.65, 100, 90.5, and 100%, respectively. All eight nodules with diagnosis of follicular adenoma had preoperative USE score-2. The sensitivity of preoperative USG, USE, and FNA in picking up malignancy was 66.67, 87.88, and 69.70%, respectively. Specificity of USG, USE, and FNA in detecting thyroid malignancy was 88.10, 100, and 97.6%, respectively. False positivity rates for USG, USE, and FNA in diagnosing thyroid malignancy was 11.9, 0, and 2.4%, respectively. The overall diagnostic accuracy of USG, USE, and FNA cytology in this study was 82.05, 96.58, and 89.74%, respectively. Conclusion:: USE may be better than USG for preoperative detection of malignancy in thyroid nodules.",2018 Sep-Oct
381,"Ruospo M,Palmer SC,Natale P,Craig JC,Vecchio M,Elder GJ,Strippoli GF",Phosphate binders for preventing and treating chronic kidney disease‐mineral and bone disorder (CKD‐MBD).,"Background: Phosphate binders are used to reduce positive phosphate balance and to lower serum phosphate levels for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with the aim to prevent progression of chronic kidney disease‐mineral and bone disorder (CKD‐MBD). This is an update of a review first published in 2011. Objectives: The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of phosphate binders for people with CKD with particular reference to relevant biochemical end‐points, musculoskeletal and cardiovascular morbidity, hospitalisation, and death. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 12 July 2018 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs of adults with CKD of any GFR category comparing a phosphate binder to another phosphate binder, placebo or usual care to lower serum phosphate. Outcomes included all‐cause and cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, adverse events, vascular calcification and bone fracture, and surrogates for such outcomes including serum phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and FGF23. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted study data. We applied the Cochrane 'Risk of Bias' tool and used the GRADE process to assess evidence certainty. We estimated treatment effects using random‐effects meta‐analysis. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes together with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or mean differences (MD) or standardised MD (SMD) for continuous outcomes. Main results: We included 104 studies involving 13,744 adults. Sixty‐nine new studies were added to this 2018 update.Most placebo or usual care controlled studies were among participants with CKD G2 to G5 not requiring dialysis (15/25 studies involving 1467 participants) while most head to head studies involved participants with CKD G5D treated with dialysis (74/81 studies involving 10,364 participants). Overall, seven studies compared sevelamer with placebo or usual care (667 participants), seven compared lanthanum to placebo or usual care (515 participants), three compared iron to placebo or usual care (422 participants), and four compared calcium to placebo or usual care (278 participants). Thirty studies compared sevelamer to calcium (5424 participants), and fourteen studies compared lanthanum to calcium (1690 participants). No study compared iron‐based binders to calcium. The remaining studies evaluated comparisons between sevelamer (hydrochloride or carbonate), sevelamer plus calcium, lanthanum, iron (ferric citrate, sucroferric oxyhydroxide, stabilised polynuclear iron(III)‐oxyhydroxide), calcium (acetate, ketoglutarate, carbonate), bixalomer, colestilan, magnesium (carbonate), magnesium plus calcium, aluminium hydroxide, sucralfate, the inhibitor of phosphate absorption nicotinamide, placebo, or usual care without binder. In 82 studies, treatment was evaluated among adults with CKD G5D treated with haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, while in 22 studies, treatment was evaluated among participants with CKD G2 to G5. The duration of study follow‐up ranged from 8 weeks to 36 months (median 3.7 months). The sample size ranged from 8 to 2103 participants (median 69). The mean age ranged between 42.6 and 68.9 years.Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were low risk in 25 and 15 studies, respectively. Twenty‐seven studies reported low risk methods for blinding of participants, investigators, and outcome assessors. Thirty‐one studies were at low risk of attrition bias and 69 studies were at low risk of selective reporting bias.In CKD G2 to G5, compared with placebo or usual care, sevelamer, lanthanum, iron and calcium‐based phosphate binders had uncertain or inestimable effects on death (all causes), cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, fracture, or coronary artery calcification. Sevelamer may lead to constipation (RR 6.92, CI 2.24 to 21.4; low certainty) and lanthanum (RR 2.98, CI 1.21 to 7.30, moderate certainty) and iron‐based binders (RR 2.66, CI 1.15 to 6.12, moderate certainty) probably increased constipation compared with placebo or usual care. Lanthanum may result in vomiting (RR 3.72, CI 1.36 to 10.18, low certainty). Iron‐based binders probably result in diarrhoea (RR 2.81, CI 1.18 to 6.68, high certainty), while the risks of other adverse events for all binders were uncertain.In CKD G5D sevelamer may lead to lower death (all causes) (RR 0.53, CI 0.30 to 0.91, low certainty) and induce less hypercalcaemia (RR 0.30, CI 0.20 to 0.43, low certainty) when compared with calcium‐based binders, and has uncertain or inestimable effects on cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, fracture, or coronary artery calcification. The finding of lower death with sevelamer compared with calcium was present when the analysis was restricted to studies at low risk of bias (RR 0.50, CI 0.32 to 0.77). In absolute terms, sevelamer may lower risk of death (all causes) from 210 per 1000 to 105 per 1000 over a follow‐up of up to 36 months, compared to calcium‐based binders. Compared with calcium‐based binders, lanthanum had uncertain effects with respect to all‐cause or cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, fracture, or coronary artery calcification and probably had reduced risks of treatment‐related hypercalcaemia (RR 0.16, CI 0.06 to 0.43, low certainty). There were no head‐to‐head studies of iron‐based binders compared with calcium. The paucity of placebo‐controlled studies in CKD G5D has led to uncertainty about the effects of phosphate binders on patient‐important outcomes compared with placebo.It is uncertain whether the effects of binders on clinically‐relevant outcomes were different for patients who were and were not treated with dialysis in subgroup analyses. Authors' conclusions: In studies of adults with CKD G5D treated with dialysis, sevelamer may lower death (all causes) compared to calcium‐based binders and incur less treatment‐related hypercalcaemia, while we found no clinically important benefits of any phosphate binder on cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, fracture or coronary artery calcification. The effects of binders on patient‐important outcomes compared to placebo are uncertain. In patients with CKD G2 to G5, the effects of sevelamer, lanthanum, and iron‐based phosphate binders on cardiovascular, vascular calcification, and bone outcomes compared to placebo or usual care, are also uncertain and they may incur constipation, while iron‐based binders may lead to diarrhoea.",2018

We here summarize findings from computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) analyses of PEA to improve the diagnosis and differentiation of this rare tumor.We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical findings, radiological imaging, and pathological findings of 6 cases of primary PEA confirmed by surgery, biopsy, and pathology. All cases were evaluated by CT and x-ray prior to surgery, and 2 cases were further examined by PET/CT.CT images indicated maximum tumor diameters of 2.4 to 9.8 cm and inhomogeneous density, with 1 case exhibiting nodular calcification. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed inhomogeneous enhancement with visible necrosis in all 6 cases, while 3 cases had hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastasis. Five cases displayed extensive tumor involvement with extension into the chest wall, mild-to-moderate levels of pleural effusion, and varying degrees of volume loss in the corresponding hemithorax. One case had limited pleural thickening and invasion. Preoperative PET/CT of 1 case revealed abnormal fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake by the tumor and multiple enlarged right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, right diffuse pleural thickening, and systemic multiple bone metastasis. In the other case, PET/CT scan at 7 months after surgery revealed pleural thickening and mediastinal lymph nodes with increased 18F-FDG uptake on the surgical side. Immunohistochemistry analyses determined that all 6 tumors were positive for CD34, CD31, ERG, and vimentin.CT and PET/CT findings reveal that malignant characteristics, including extensive pleural thickening, invasion and metastasis, and pleural effusion, are common in PEA. Imaging data are only supportive; therefore, the final diagnosis should be based on pathology and immunohistochemistry analyses.",2018 Aug
383,Windt DL,Monochromatic mammography using scanning multilayer X-ray mirrors.,"A prototype system for breast imaging using monochromatic X-rays has been developed using a scanning multilayer X-ray mirror in combination with a conventional mammography tube and an imaging detector. The X-ray mirror produces a monochromatic fan beam tuned near 19 keV, with an energy bandpass of approximately 1.5 keV. Rotating the mirror about the tube’s focal spot in synchronization with the X-ray generator and detector enables the acquisition of monochromatic X-ray images over large areas. The X-ray mirror also can be rotated completely out of the beam so that conventional polychromatic images can be acquired using a K-edge filter, facilitating direct comparison between the two modes of operation. The system was used to image synthetic, tissue-equivalent breast phantoms in order to experimentally quantify the improvements in image quality and dose that can be realized using monochromatic radiation. Nine custom phantoms spanning a range of thicknesses and glandular/adipose ratios, each containing both glandular- and calcification-equivalent features, were used to measure contrast and signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR). Mean glandular dose (MGD) was computed from measured entrance exposure, and a figure-of-merit (FOM) was computed as FOM = SDNR2/MGD in each case. Monochromatic MGD ranges from 0.606 to 0.134 of polychromatic MGD for images having comparable glandular SDNR, depending on breast thickness and glandularity; relative monochromatic dose decreases with increasing glandularity for all thicknesses. Monochromatic FOM values are higher than the corresponding polychromatic FOM values in all but one case. Additionally, the monochromatic contrast for glandular features is higher than the polychromatic contrast in all but one case as well. These results represent important steps toward the realization of clinically practical monochromatic X-ray breast imaging systems having lower dose and better image quality, including those for digital mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, contrast-enhanced spectral mammography and other modalities, for safer, more accurate breast cancer detection, diagnosis and staging.",2018 Aug
384,"Mao X,Liu H,Du J,Yu N,Chen L,Zhang L",Imaging findings of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor in breast: A case report.,"Rationale:: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs), particularly breast IMTs, are rare neoplastic lesions typically associated with a favorable prognosis. Breast IMTs are easily misdiagnosed as other types of malignant lesions, and therefore there is a significant unmet need for a better preoperational differential diagnosis based on imaging manifestations. Here, we report the imaging findings of a breast IMT and compare our findings with previously published features of breast IMTs. Patient concerns:: The patient, a 43-year-old female, reported the presence of a palpable lump within her left breast. An ultrasound examination revealed an irregular hypoechoic mass with unclear boundaries. Mammography demonstrated a mass of heterogeneous and striped density with granular calcification. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) inspection displayed an irregular tissue lump with an undistinguishable boundary and a further dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI disclosed an associated efflux change. Diagnoses:: Breast inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. Interventions:: Breast needle biopsy and mammary resection were performed. Pathological staining of the bulk resected tumor after preoperative preparation revealed that the tumor-like tissue was enriched for spindle cells arranged in fascicular clusters. Histopathological diagnosis and immunohistochemistry confirmed the mass as being a breast IMT. Outcomes:: No metastatic recurrence was found during 6-month or 1-year follow-ups. Lessons:: Breast IMTs commonly develop in elderly women with atypical imaging features. They are primarily composed of lobular soft tissues infiltrated with an abundant focal blood supply and granular calcification. Development of breast IMTs is closely related to trauma. A preliminary diagnosis of such masses can be made based on combined manifestations of both clinical and imaging features, while a final confirmation still requires pathological staining. Imaging examinations are of value for such tumors to define the lesion edges and their associations with adjacent tissues.",2018 Aug
385,"Jang S,Kim JH,Hur BY,Ahn SJ,Joo I,Kim MJ,Han JK",Role of CT in Differentiating Malignant Focal Splenic Lesions.,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to asses the CT findings and clinical features differentiating malignant from benign focal splenic lesions. Materials and Methods: Among 673 patients with splenectomy, we included 114 patients with pathologically confirmed focal splenic lesions (malignant = 66, benign = 48). Two radiologists retrospectively assessed CT findings including: size, number, solid component, margin, wall, calcification, contrast-enhancement, lymph node (LN) enlargement and possible malignancy. We assessed clinical features including age, sex, underlying malignancy, fever, and leukocytosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors of malignant lesion. We used receiver operating curve analysis for determination of diagnostic performance. Results: Common findings of malignant lesions include enhanced, mainly solid, ill-defined margin, absence of splenomegaly, absence of the wall, absence of calcification, LN enlargement, and presence of underlying malignancy (p < 0.05). Among them, mainly solid features (odds ratio [OR], 39.098, p = 0.007), LN enlargement (OR, 6.326, p = 0.005), and presence of underlying malignancy (OR, 8.615, p = 0.001) were significant predictors of malignancy. The mean size of benign splenic lesions (5.8 ± 3.3 cm) was larger than that of malignant splenic lesions (4.0 ± 3.4 cm). Diagnostic performance of CT findings by two reviewers using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for differentiation of malignant lesions was 0.856 and 0.893, respectively. Conclusion: Solid nature of the splenic mass on CT images, LN enlargement, and presence of underlying malignancy are significant predictors of malignant splenic lesion.",2018 Sep-Oct

Our laboratory recently reported that the collagen receptor discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) mediates vascular calcification in atherosclerosis; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. During calcification, vascular smooth muscle cells transdifferentiate into osteoblast-like cells, in a process driven by the transcription factor RUNX2 (runt-related transcription factor 2). DDR1 signals via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, which is also central to insulin signaling, and upstream of RUNX2, and this led us to investigate whether DDR1 promotes vascular calcification in diabetes mellitus via this pathway. Approach and Results—: Ddr1+/+; Ldlr−/− (single knock-out) and Ddr1−/−; Ldlr−/− (double knock-out) mice were placed on high-fat diet for 12 weeks to induce atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Von Kossa staining revealed reduced vascular calcification in the aortic arch of double knock-out compared with single knock-out mice. Immunofluorescent staining for RUNX2 was present in calcified plaques of single knock-out but not double knock-out mice. Primary vascular smooth muscle cells obtained from Ddr1+/+ and Ddr1−/− mice were cultured in calcifying media. DDR1 deletion resulted in reduced calcification, a 74% reduction in p-Akt levels, and an 88% reduction in RUNX2 activity. Subcellular fractionation revealed a 77% reduction in nuclear RUNX2 levels in Ddr1−/− vascular smooth muscle cells. DDR1 associated with phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and treatment with the inhibitor wortmannin attenuated calcification. Finally, we show that DDR1 is important to maintain the microtubule cytoskeleton which is required for the nuclear localization of RUNX2. Conclusions—: These novel findings demonstrate that DDR1 promotes RUNX2 activity and atherosclerotic vascular calcification in diabetes mellitus via phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling.

387,"Dayanand P,Sandhyavenu H,Dayanand S,Martinez J,Rangaswami J",Role of Bisphosphonates in Vascular Calcification and Bone Metabolism: A Clinical Summary.,"Background:: Vascular calcification is known to be a strong risk factor for cardiovascularadverse events and mortality. Atherosclerosis, diabetes, aging, abnormal bone mineral homeostasisand high uremic milieu such as chronic kidney disease are major factors that contribute to theprogression of vascular calcification. Several mechanisms such as the osteoblastic transition of vascularsmooth muscle cells in response to oxidative stress have shed light on the active nature ofvascular calcification, which was once thought to be a passive process. The fine interplay of regulatoryfactors such as PTH, vitamin D3, FGF 23 and klotho reflect the delicate balance between vascularcalcification and bone mineralization. Any disturbance affecting this equilibrium of the bonemineral-vascular axis results in accelerated vascular calcification. Bisphosphonates share similar mechanism of action as statins, and hence several studies were undertakenin humans to verify if the benefits proven to be obtained in animal models extended tohuman models too. This yielded conflicting outcomes which are outlined in this review. This wasattributed mainly to inadequate sample size and flaws in the study design. Therefore, this benefitcan only be ascertained if studies addressing this are undertaken. Conclusion:: This review seeks to highlight the pathophysiologic phenomena implicated in vascular and valvular calcification and summarize the literature available regarding the use of bisphosphonates in animal and human models. We also discuss novel treatment approaches for vascular calcification,with emphasis on chronic kidney disease and calciphylaxis.",2018 Aug
388,"Ochieng J,Nangami G,Sakwe A,Moye C,Alvarez J,Whalen D,Thomas P,Lammers P",Impact of Fetuin-A (AHSG) on Tumor Progression and Type 2 Diabetes.,"Fetuin-A is the protein product of the AHSG gene in humans. It is mainly synthesized by the liver in adult humans and is secreted into the blood where its concentration can vary from a low of ~0.2 mg/mL to a high of ~0.8 mg/mL. Presently, it is considered to be a multifunctional protein that plays important roles in diabetes, kidney disease, and cancer, as well as in inhibition of ectopic calcification. In this review we have focused on work that has been done regarding its potential role(s) in tumor progression and sequelae of diabetes. Recently a number of laboratories have demonstrated that a subset of tumor cells such as pancreatic, prostate and glioblastoma multiform synthesize ectopic fetuin-A, which drives their progression. Fetuin-A that is synthesized, modified, and secreted by tumor cells may be more relevant in understanding the pathophysiological role of this enigmatic protein in tumors, as opposed to the relatively high serum concentrations of the liver derived protein. Lastly, auto-antibodies to fetuin-A frequently appear in the sera of tumor patients that could be useful as biomarkers for early diagnosis. In diabetes, solid experimental evidence shows that fetuin-A binds the β-subunit of the insulin receptor to attenuate insulin signaling, thereby contributing to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Fetuin-A also may, together with free fatty acids, induce apoptotic signals in the beta islets cells of the pancreas, reducing the secretion of insulin and further exacerbating T2DM.",2018 Aug
389,"Ha J,Lee J,Jo K,Han JS,Kim MH,Jung CK,Kang MI,Cha BY,Lim DJ",Calcification Patterns in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma are Associated with Changes in Thyroid Hormones and Coronary Artery Calcification.,"Recent studies suggested that a lower serum thyroid hormone level is associated with more vascular calcification. However, it has been rarely evaluated whether lower thyroid hormone levels affect the calcification of thyroid cancer and there is a relationship between calcification patterns of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and coronary artery calcification (CAC). The study was divided into two groups: First, we retrospectively reviewed 182 PTC patients and examined the correlation between PTC calcification patterns and CAC by coronary computed tomography (CT). Second, the correlation between the calcification pattern of PTC and thyroid hormone concentration was investigated (n = 354). The calcification pattern of PTC was evaluated by thyroid ultrasonography and classified into four groups: no-calcification, microcalcification, macrocalcification, and mixed-calcification. In PTC patients with microcalcification and mixed calcification, more CAC was observed and coronary calcium score (CCS) was higher. Lower free T4 and higher thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were associated with microcalcification and mixed calcification, not with macrocalcification and no calcification. PTC with microcalcification and mixed calcification showed more aggressive phenotypes like lymph node metastasis and more advanced TNM (tumor, node, and metastasis) stage than those with no calcification and macrocalcification. Calcification patterns of PTC showed close association with thyroid hormone levels and CAC. Further research is needed to determine how these findings are related to cardiovascular risk and disease-specific mortality.",2018 Aug

Methods: Eighty-eight patients (17 MUMPCs, 43 cPMBCs, and 28 MMBCs) were included in the study. Sonographic features according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon for ultrasound (US) were recorded and analyzed for each patient. The age, sonographic lesion size, menstrual status, mass location, palpation, tenderness, and axillary lymph node metastasis (LNM) were also analyzed. Results: Most of the MUMPCs showed an irregular shape (82.4%, 14/17), a parallel orientation (94.1%, 16/17), a non-circumscribed margin (88.2%, 15/17), and distal acoustic enhancement (88.2%, 15/17). Furthermore, MUMPC had mixed cystic and solid components (35.3%, 6/17) and hypoechoic (29.4%, 5/17) and isoechoic (35.3%, 6/17) structures, with calcification (29.4%, 5/17) and blood flow (41.2%, 7/17) within the tumor. The differences in sonographic features were not found between the MUMPC and cPMBC and between the MUMPC and MMBC. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the three groups based on age, menstrual status, mass location, palpation, and tenderness (p > 0.05). Similar axillary LNMs were observed between MUMPC and cPMBC (p > 0.05), but both MUMPC and cPMBC were statistically different from MMBC (p < 0.05), so as the lesion size. Conclusions: At this particular stage, it is challenging to distinguish MUMPC from cPMBC and MMBC on ultrasound according to the BI-RADS-US lexicon.",2018
391,"Manzoor S,Ahmed S,Ali A,Han KH,Sechopoulos I,O’Neill A,Fei B,O’Neill WC",Progression of Medial Arterial Calcification in CKD.,"Introduction: Medial arterial calcification is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and portends poor clinical outcomes, but its progression relative to the severity of CKD and the role of other risk factors is unknown because of the lack of reliable quantification. Methods: Calcification of breast arteries detected by mammography, which is exclusively medial and correlates with medial calcification in peripheral arteries and with cardiovascular outcomes, was used to measure the progression of medial arterial calcification in women with CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Measurements showed intra- and interobserver correlations of 0.98, an interstudy variability of 8% to 11%, and a correlation with computed tomographic measurements of 0.92. Results: Progression of calcification was measured in 60 control subjects (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and 137 subjects with CKD (eGFR < 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Progression in control subjects was linear over time and independent of age. The rate of progression was increased in CKD but only at eGFR < 40 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (median, 8.1 vs. 3.9 mm/breast/yr in controls; P = 0.006). Progression accelerated markedly in subjects with ESRD (median, 20 mm/breast/yr; n = 36), but did not differ from controls after kidney transplantation (n = 25). Diabetes significantly augmented progression in subjects with CKD and ESRD but not in controls. Conclusion: Mammography is a convenient and reliable method to measure the progression of medial arterial calcification. Progression does not increase until advanced stages of CKD, accelerates markedly in ESRD, and returns to control rates after kidney transplantation. Diabetes significantly increases progression in CKD and ESRD.",2018 Nov

Trade-offs between workload and sampling density means that small features can be missed. Aiming to reduce the workload of routine histology protocols and the concern over missed pathology in skipped sections, we developed a prototype x-ray tomographic scanner dedicated to rapid scouting and identification of regions of interest in pathology specimens, thereby allowing targeted histopathology analysis to replace blanket searches. In coronary artery samples of a deceased HIV patient, the scanner, called Tomopath, obtained depth-resolved cross-sectional images at 15 µm resolution in a 15-minute scan, which guided the subsequent histological sectioning and microscopy. When compared to a commercial tabletop micro-CT scanner, the prototype provided several-fold contrast-to-noise ratio in 1/11th the scan time. Correlated tomographic and histological images revealed two types of micro calcifications: scattered loose calcifications typically found in atherosclerotic lesions; isolated focal calcifications in one or several cells in the internal elastic lamina and occasionally in the tunica media, which we speculate were the initiation of medial calcification linked to kidney disease, but rarely detected at this early stage due to their similarity to particle contaminants introduced during histological processing, if not for the evidence from the tomography scan prior to sectioning. Thus, in addition to its utility as a scouting tool, in this study it provided complementary information to histological microscopy. Overall, the prototype scanner represents a step toward a dedicated scouting and complementary imaging tool for routine use in pathology labs.",2018

The impact of clinicopathological factors on the occurrence of IMLN metastasis was assessed in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, and a nomogram (model) was constructed to predict the IMLN status. DFS difference was evaluated in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses between IMLN-negative and IMLN-positive patients, and univariate analysis was performed to compare DFS between individuals with high and low IMLN metastasis risk defined by proposed nomogram.Of 1977 enrolled patients, 514 cases underwent IMLN dissection and 1463 cases did not undergo IMLN irradiation or dissection. We found that initial disease symptoms and signs, mammographic calcification, tumor site, number of positive axillary lymph nodes (ALNs), American Joint Committee on Cancer pT stage, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status were associated with IMLN metastasis (all P < .05). Those variables were included in nomogram, whose predictive ability was better than that of ALN classification (area under the curve: 0.82 vs 0.76, P < .001). Univariate cox proportional hazards model indicated that better DFS was observed in IMLN-negative patients than IMLN-positive group (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05–3.34; P = .04), whereas no significant differences in DFS (HR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.49–2.00; P = .97) were found after adjusting patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors.Nipple inversion, mammographic calcification, larger tumor size, medial tumor site, negative HER-2 status, and more positive ALNs are independent risk factors for IMLN metastasis, and the individualized nomogram is a feasible tool to predict the status of IMLN. Equivalent DFS was found between positive and negative IMLN patients who all accepted IMLN dissection and systemic therapies.",2018 Jul

The proximal type of ES occurs in various locations. We present a resected case with proximal-type ES that occurred in the chest wall and discuss the relevant literature. Case presentation: A 47-year-old woman was referred for a 6-month history of a right anterior chest mass with tenderness. Chest computed tomography showed an invasive chest wall mass with calcification surrounding the third rib. Aspiration biopsy cytology suggested malignancy. We performed wide resection, including the middle part of the pectoralis major muscle, the pectoralis minor muscle, the third and fourth ribs, and reconstruction of the chest wall, using a 2-mm polytetrafluoroethylene patch. Severe deformation of the chest wall was avoided. Postoperative physical therapy of the shoulder was effective for the continuous pain and weakness of the arm. She has remained alive for 1 year and 10 months without recurrence. Our literature review showed five previously reported cases of ES in the chest wall, and all of these were surgically resected. Two of these patients suffered from frequent local recurrence and died of disease. Conclusions: ES in the chest wall is rare. Previous reports have indicated that surgical resection with tumor-free margins is essential for treatment. We performed complete resection of the tumor in our case, and a polytetrafluoroethylene patch was effective for reconstructing the deficit in the chest wall.",2018 Dec
395,Das DK,Functional State of Cells During their Life and on their Journey Toward Inactivity and Death: Search for Morphological Evidence in Thyroid Fine Needle Aspiration Smears.,"Synthesis and storage of thyroglobulin as well as synthesis of thyroid hormones and their release into the circulation are important functions of thyroid, which were studied in fine needle aspiration (FNA) smears from thyroid lesions. Evidence of thyroglobulin synthesis was demonstrated in neoplastic and nonneoplastic follicular cells, especially in Hürthle cells, in the form of colloid inclusions. Whereas the pinocytic vesicles containing colloid at the luminal end of in nonneoplastic and neoplastic follicular cells indicated engulfment of colloid for synthesis of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), the marginal vacuoles (MVs) (fire-flare appearance) at the basal aspects of follicular cells suggested their release on way to the interfollicular capillaries. The morphological evidence of secretary activity could also be demonstrated in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in the form of azurophilic granules, marginal vacuoles, and intracytoplasmic lumina (ICL) with secretions; the secretory material, likely to be amyloid, present in MTC cells, and their release to the extracellular space was confirmed by positive immunocytochemical staining for calcitonin. It was found that nuclear grooves and related intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions (INCIs) in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) possibly represent an initial step of a degenerative process leading to formation of inactive cerebriform nuclei. Based on observation regarding formation and release of precursor substances for psammoma bodies (PBs), it was also suggested that PBs may not represent a process of dystrophic calcification over infarcted/dead papillae but suggest an active biological process, which leads to inhibition of growth of neoplastic cells and acts as a barrier against spread of PTC.",2018 Jul-Sep

Given that the prognosis of ovarian SBT/APST with no invasive features is excellent, remote relapse after surgery can pose a diagnostic pitfall. Bone metastasis as transformed low-grade carcinoma is an extremely rare initial presentation of recurrence in patients whose primary tumor was confined to the ovaries. Case presentation: A 55-year-old Japanese woman who had undergone surgery for a right ovarian tumor 13 years previously presented with right-lateral chest pain and neurologic abnormalities in the lower limbs. Computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an irregular mass in the right arch of the 12th thoracic vertebra, extending through the intervertebral foramen and into surrounding soft tissue, the maximum diameter of the whole mass being 78 mm. Pathological examination of a CT-guided needle biopsy of the paraspinal lesion demonstrated papillary cell clusters with blunt nuclear atypia and psammomatous calcification that were positive for PAX8, estrogen receptor, and WT1, but negative for thyroglobulin on immunohistochemical testing, and of a P53 non-mutational pattern. On clinicopathologic review, the previous 13- × 11- × 9-cm ovarian tumor was an intracystic and exophytic papillary growth without surface involvement; it had ruptured intraoperatively. Microscopically there was serous epithelium with minimal cytologic atypia proliferating in hierarchical branches with no invasive foci or micropapillary components. The tumor was confined to the right ovary with no peritoneal implants. Neither primary nor metastatic tumor harbored KRAS/BRAF mutations according to polymerase chain reaction using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. We concluded that, after a 13-year disease-free interval, the paraspinal lesion was bone metastasis of low-grade carcinoma originating from the ovarian SBT/APST. The patient received radiotherapy for the paraspinal lesion followed by administration of paclitaxel and carboplatin plus bevacizumab and remains alive 168 months after the initial surgery. Conclusions: Pathologists and radiologists should not exclude late recurrence of ovarian SBT/APST when bone metastases are suspected, even when neither peritoneal nor lymph node involvement are detected. Long-term surveillance of women with ovarian serous tumors with no invasive features is recommended.",2018

However, it currently remains unclear whether these drugs modulate coronary atheroma calcification in vivo. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores (Agatston Units, AUs) were estimated in 120 patients receiving coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) (63% males; median age 56 years). The CAC scores were compared among the three groups: (1) neither statin nor PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, (2) statin monotherapy, and (3) statin and PCSK9 inhibitor combination therapy in an unpaired cross-sectional study. Additionally, CCTA was performed twice at an interval in 15 patients undergoing statin monotherapy to compare the previous (baseline) and subsequent (follow-up) CAC scores in a paired longitudinal study. In addition, a PCSK9 inhibitor was administered to 16 patients undergoing statin therapy. Before and after that, CCTA was performed twice to compare the previous and subsequent CAC scores in a paired longitudinal study. The unpaired cross-sectional study and paired longitudinal study consist of completely different patients. Among 120 patients, 40 (33%) had a CAC score >100 AUs. The median CAC score increased in the following order: statin group, statin and PCSK9 group, and no-statin-no-PCSK9 group. Annual CAC score progression was 29.7% by statin monotherapy and 14.3% following the addition of the PCSK9 inhibitor to statin therapy. The annual rate of CAC with the combination therapy with a PCSK9 inhibitor and a statin is lower than that with statin monotherapy. CAC may be prevented with PCSK9 Inhibitor.",2018
398,"Zhuang Y,Li C,Hua Z,Chen K,Lin JL",A novel TIRADS of US classification.,"Background: Thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TIRADS) is the assessment of a risk stratification of thyroid nodules, usually using a score. However, there is no consensus as to the version of TIRADS for reporting the results of thyroid ultrasound in clinic. The objective of this study is to develop a practical TIRADS with which to categorize thyroid nodules and stratify their malignant risk. Methods: A TIRADS scoring system was developed to provide more decision levels than standard scoring through the selection of the ultrasound features which include the calcification shape, margins, taller-than-wide, internal echo, blood flow quantization of features, setting of the weight, and calculation of the score. Ultimately, the accuracy of our TIRADS was evaluated by comparing with the results of current vision of TIRADS and thyroid radiologist in 153 patients who had US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Results: Classification results showed that the total accuracy reached 97% (100% of malignant and 95% of the benign) in 153 cases (benign:78, malignant:75). The percentages of malignancy is defined in our TIRADS were as follows: TIRADS 2 (0% malignancy), TIRADS 3 (3.6% malignancy), TIRADS 4 (17–75% malignancy), and TIRADS 5 (98% malignancy). Conclusions: We established a novel TIRADS to predict the malignancy risk of the thyroid nodules based on six categories US features by a scoring system, which included a standardized vocabulary and score and a quantified risk assessment. The results showed that objective quantitative classification of thyroid nodules by our TIRADS can be useful in guiding management decisions.",2018

VC occurrences involve complicated mechanism networks, such as matrix vesicles or exosomes production, osteogenic differentiation, reduced cell viability, aging and so on. However, with present therapeutic methods targeting at VC ineffectively, novel targets for VC treatment are demanded. Exosomes are proven to participate in VC and function as initializers for mineral deposition. Secreted exosomes loaded with microRNAs are also demonstrated to modulate VC procession in recipient vascular smooth muscle cells.

This property of vitamin K has led to an increased interest in novel methods for accurate vitamin K detection. Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) could offer a solution, as they have been used as synthetic receptors in a large variety of biomimetic sensors for the detection of similar molecules over the past few decades, because of their robust nature and remarkable selectivity. In this article, the authors introduce a novel imprinting approach to create a MIP that is able to selectively rebind vitamin K1. As the native structure of the vitamin does not allow for imprinting, an alternative imprinting strategy was developed, using the synthetic compound menadione (vitamin K3) as a template. Target rebinding was analyzed by means of UV-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy and two custom-made thermal readout techniques. This analysis reveals that the MIP-based sensor reacts to an increasing concentration of both menadione and vitamin K1. The Limit of Detection (LoD) for both compounds was established at 700 nM for the Heat Transfer Method (HTM), while the optimized readout approach, Thermal Wave Transport Analysis (TWTA), displayed an increased sensitivity with a LoD of 200 nM. The sensor seems to react to a lesser extent to Vitamin E, the analogue under study. To further demonstrate its potential application in biochemical research, the sensor was used to measure the absorption of vitamin K in blood serum after taking vitamin K supplements. By employing a gradual enrichment strategy, the sensor was able to detect the difference between baseline and peak absorption samples and was able to quantify the vitamin K concentration in good agreement with a validation experiment using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). In this way, the authors provide a first proof of principle for a low-cost, straightforward, and label-free vitamin K sensor.",2018 Jun

We report an extremely rare case of giant cell tumor of soft tissue arising from retroperitoneal tissue. Case Report:: A 78-year-old man visited our medical center with the chief complaint of fatigue and weight loss for 1 month. He had a hard and immobilized mass without pain in the left upper quadrant. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a huge tumor (22×20×16 cm) in the retroperitoneal space, and it invaded into the stomach, colon, pancreas, spleen, and left kidney. MRI demonstrated the tumor had a serous cystic component as T1 was low, T2 was high, and DWI was slightly high. We diagnosed the retroperitoneal malignant tumor, and tumor resection was performed with total gastrectomy, partial colectomy, distal pancreatectomy, left nephrectomy, and left adrenal-ectomy for complete resection, without any postoperative complications. The tumor predominantly consisted of a solid mass, and had necrotic lesions, cystic lesions, and calcification. The histological exam showed it was composed of spindle and multinucleated giant cells; however, there was no cellular atypia or pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical staining characterized the tumor with CD68+, SMA+, CD34–, Desmin–, and S-100–. We finally diagnosed it as GCT-ST with the intermediate group of malignancy, according to WHO criteria. Thereafter, the patient had no recurrence at 1 year after resection.

EVs carry biologically active molecules, thus providing signals that influence a spectrum of functions in recipient cells during various physiological and pathological processes. Recent findings point to EVs as very attractive immunomodulatory therapeutic agents, vehicles for drug delivery and diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in liquid biopsies. In addition, EVs interact with and regulate the synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, which is crucial for organ development and wound healing, as well as bone and cardiovascular calcification. EVs carrying matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in ECM remodeling, thus modifying tumor microenvironment and contributing to premetastatic niche formation and angiogenesis.

Consequently, the early detection of CC by imaging may be of great significance in guiding patient management and therapeutic decisions. The present study aimed to analyze 18F-FDG PET/CT findings of CC in comparison to MRI and CT. PET/CT findings in 5 patients with CC were retrospectively reviewed based on visual interpretation and semi-quantitative index of SUVmax and TNR. Four patients received dual-time-point PET/CT scans. Additionally, one patient underwent contrast-enhanced CT scan, one MRI, and three received both. A total of five lesions were detected in five patients. Visually, two cases presented with mild FDG uptake, two with moderate and one with high. The mean of SUVmax and TNR was 5.1±2.2 and 2.8±0.7, respectively. Compared with CCs with low SUVmax, CCs with high SUVmax were more aggressive. No distant metastases were observed in five cases. Among four patients with dual-time-point PET/CT imaging, SUVmax increased in three cases and decreased in one case. The mean early and delayed SUVmax were 4.2±1.1 and 4.7±1.9, respectively (P>0.05). Radiological findings mainly included septated cystic components, internal sponge-like contrast-enhancement, calcification and ‘salt-and-pepper sign’ on MRI T2-weighted imaging. Thus, PET/CT provided additional information on metabolic tumor activity as well as locoregional and distant staging, which are important prognostic markers and may improve further patient management. However, PET/CT did not show any findings in addition to MRI and contrast-enhanced CT that were unique to CC and allowed a clear differentiation from other pancreatic malignancies.",2018 Aug
405,"Demer LL,Hsu JJ,Tintut Y",Steroid hormone vitamin D: Implications for cardiovascular disease.,"Understanding of vitamin D physiology is important because about half of the population is being diagnosed with deficiency and treated with supplements. Clinical guidelines were developed based on observational studies showing an association between low serum levels and increased cardiovascular risk. However, new randomized-controlled trials have failed to confirm any cardiovascular benefit from supplementation in the general population. A major concern is that excess vitamin D is known to cause calcific vasculopathy and valvulopathy in animal models. For decades, administration of vitamin D has been used in rodents as a reliable experimental model of vascular calcification. Technically, vitamin D is a misnomer. It is not a true vitamin because it can be synthesized endogenously through ultraviolet exposure of the skin. It is a steroid hormone that comes in three forms that are sequential metabolites produced by hydroxylases. As a fat-soluble hormone, the vitamin D-hormone metabolites must have special mechanisms for delivery in the aqueous blood stream. Importantly, endogenously synthesized forms are carried by a binding protein, whereas dietary forms are carried within lipoprotein particles. This may result in distinct bio-distributions for sunlight-derived vs. supplement-derived vitamin D-hormones. Since the cardiovascular effects of vitamin D-hormones are not straightforward, both toxic and beneficial effects may result from current recommendations.",2018 May 25

We considered that higher blood pressure over 25 years among women with preterm delivery may be associated with coronary artery calcification (CAC). The CARDIA study enrolled 1,049 black and white women with births between 1985 and 2010 (n=272 ever preterm [<37 weeks]; n=777 all term births [≥37 weeks). Latent mixture modeling identified blood pressure trajectories across 20 years and these were related to CAC at years 20 and 25. Three systolic blood pressure (SBP) patterns were identified: low-stable (n=563, 53%), moderate (n=416, 40%), and moderate-increasing (n=70, 7%). Women with moderate-increasing SBP were more likely to have delivered preterm compared to those in the low-stable group (40% vs. 21%, p<0.0001) and they were more likely to have CAC (38.5% vs. 12.2%). The SBP and CAC association varied by preterm birth (p-interaction=0.04). Women with preterm delivery and a moderate-increasing SBP had a 2.17-fold higher hazards of CAC (95% CI 1.14, 4.12) compared to women with term births and a lower SBP pattern, adjusted for CVD risk factors and other pregnancy features. There was no excess CAC in women with moderate-increasing SBP and term births (adjusted HR 1.02 [0.49, 2.14). Associations were stronger in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, but also detected in those with normotensive preterm deliveries. Women who deliver preterm infants are more likely to follow a high-risk blood pressure pattern throughout the childbearing years that is associated with CAC at midlife.",2018 Jul

We investigated the relevance of ultrasonic features of breast cancer and expression levels of C-erbB-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nm23 and its clinical significance. A total of 76 patients with breast cancer were recruited who were admitted to The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from January, 2016 to August, 2017. All patients underwent color Doppler ultrasonic imaging, and expression levels of C-erbB-2, VEGF and nm23 in their tumor tissues were measured by immunohistochemistry. The ultrasonic features were evaluated and compared with the expression levels of C-erbB-2, VEGF and nm23 for each patient. Ultrasonography showed a tumor mass with spiculated margins, abnormal vasculature, and a diameter no less than 3 cm, as well as lymph node metastasis. The above signs were associated with high expression of C-erbB-2, VEGF and nm23 (p<0.05), but calcification was not associated with high expression of these biomarkers (p>0.05). For patients with highly expressed C-erbB-2 and VEGF, the time to peak (TTP) of the time-intensity curve obtained by contrast enhanced ultrasound was shorter, while the peak intensity (PI) was higher. On the contrary, for patients with highly expressed nm23, the TTP was apparently longer, while the PI was lower (p<0.05). The ultrasonic features of breast cancer were relevant to the expression levels of C-erbB-2, VEGF and nm23. Thus, the expression levels of C-erbB-2, VEGF and nm23 were predictable indirectly according to the ultrasonic features of the patient, which can be used as a reference for breast cancer treatment and prognosis prediction.",2018 Aug

It may occur in a wide range of anatomical locations. One-third are found in the respiratory tract. We report two cases of IMT of the airway diagnosed at our institution. Case Report:: Case 1: A 6-year-old male child presented with a 1-month history of hoarseness of the voice. On evaluation, a polypoid nodule was noted in the right vocal cord which was excised through the endolaryngeal route. Histopathology was suggestive of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative IMT. He presented with recurrence after 4 months, for which he underwent endolaryngeal reexcision and tracheostomy for airway protection. A third recurrence after 6 months was managed with laser excision, and the patient was started on oral celecoxib. After 1.5 years of follow up, endoscopic examination showed no recurrence, and celecoxib was continued. Case 2: A 7-year-old male child presented with cough and respiratory distress. Bronchoscopy and high resolution computed tomography showed a polypoidal lesion with calcification arising from the left anterolateral wall of the trachea with significant narrowing of the lumen. The patient underwent biopsy followed by endoscopic excision, and was diagnosed with IMT. Currently the patient is under follow up with no recurrence. Conclusion:: IMT indicates a proliferative myofibroblastic growth. Surgical resection should be recommended for all lesions if not prohibited by anatomic location or morbidity. Patients should be followed up closely for recurrence. In most cases, complete surgical excision will suffice; however multiple recurrences can be managed with chemotherapy. These two cases highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in rare tumors in difficult anatomical locations.",2018 May

He had undergone Billroth-II subtotal gastrectomy for a bleeding gastric ulcer 30 years ago. Abdominal CT showed irregular thickening of the gastric wall and miliary calcifications. Histologic examination of specimen obtained by endoscopic biopsy showed poorly differentiated calcified signet-ring gastric cancer. The patient was clinically staged T4N2M0 and treated with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF)/oxaliplatin and S-1 (XLOX)/S-1. After five cycles of chemotherapy, the general condition of the patient improved and tumor markers (CEA, CA125, CA199) decreased. However, follow-up CT scans showed continuing increase in the calcification. Conclusions: To conclude, in this case report we have described the dynamic changes in calcification in a gastric cancer patient receiving chemotherapy. One explanation for the observed increase in calcifications could be that the ischemic necrosis resulting from chemotherapy creates an alkaline environment, which promotes deposition of calcium salts. Our theory needs to be confirmed with histological evidence from a large series of patients. Nevertheless, we hope that these findings will improve understanding of the mechanism of calcification in gastric cancer.",2018

Chondroitin sulphate nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with catechin were prepared by an ionic gelation method using AlCl3 and optimised for polymer and cross‐linking agent concentration, curing time and stirring speed. Zeta potential, particle size, loading efficiency, and release efficiency over 24 h (RE24 %) were evaluated. The surface morphology of NPs was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and their thermal behaviour by differential scanning calorimetric. Antioxidant effect of NPs was determined by chelating activity of iron ions. The cell viability of mesenchymal stem cells was determined by 3‐[4, 5‐dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl]‐2, 5‐diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay and the calcification of osteoblasts was studied by Alizarin red staining. The optimised NPs showed particle size of 176 nm, zeta potential of −20.8 mV, loading efficiency of 93.3% and RE24 % of 80.6%. The chatechin loaded chondroitin sulphate NPs showed 70‐fold more antioxidant activity, 3‐fold proliferation effect and higher calcium precipitation in osteoblasts than free catechin.",2018 Sep

Spindle cell lesions occurring in soft tissues can occur in breast with overlapping morphologies. It can present as benign lesion and have inconclusive cytological findings, so easily missed if not properly dealt with. Stromal sarcoma should be diagnosed only after thorough sectioning and negative staining for p63, broad spectrum, and high molecular weight keratin. We present a case of right breast lump. Cytological features revealed fibro histiocytic lesion. There were no areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, or calcification. Histopathologically, it showed partially encapsulated tumor with cells arranged in sheets, composed of oval to epithelioid cells with spindling at places with moderate pleomorphism (mitotic activity 6–7/10 hpf). Differential diagnosis of primary stromal sarcoma, metaplastic sarcoma, and phyllodes was made. Immunohistochemistry revealed vimentin positivity with focal positivity of S-100. Desmin, cytokeratin and smooth muscle actin, p63, ER, PR, and Her2-neu were negative. A final diagnosis of primary breast sarcoma of neural origin was established with the help of histopathology and immunohistochemistry. To conclude, it is of utmost importance to identify primary stromal sarcomas as they are known to spread very rapidly and have a poor prognosis.",2018 Sep

NFATc4). To better understand how methylation mediates these actions, MS was performed on VSM cell extracts from control and LRP6-deficient mice. LRP6-dependent Arg methylation was regulated on >500 proteins; only 21 exhibited increased monomethylation (MMA) with concomitant reductions in dimethylation. G3BP1, a known regulator of arteriosclerosis, exhibited a >30-fold increase in MMA in its C-terminal domain. Co-transfection studies confirm that G3BP1 (G3BP is Ras-GAP SH3 domain–binding protein) methylation is inhibited by LRP6 and that G3BP1 stimulates NFATc4 transcription. NFATc4 association with VSM osteopontin (OPN) and alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) chromatin was increased with LRP6 deficiency and reduced with G3BP1 deficiency. G3BP1 activation of NFATc4 mapped to G3BP1 domains supporting interactions with RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I), a stimulus for mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) that drives cardiovascular calcification in humans when mutated in Singleton-Merten syndrome (SGMRT2). Gain-of-function SGMRT2/RIG-I mutants increased G3BP1 methylation and synergized with osteogenic transcription factors (Runx2 and NFATc4). A chemical antagonist of G3BP, C108 (C108 is 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2-[1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)ethylidene]hydrazide CAS 15533-09-2), down-regulated RIG-I–stimulated G3BP1 methylation, Wnt/NFAT signaling, VSM TNAP activity, and calcification. G3BP1 deficiency reduced RIG-I protein levels and VSM osteogenic programs. Like G3BP1 and RIG-I deficiency, MAVS deficiency reduced VSM osteogenic signals, including TNAP activity and Wnt5-dependent nuclear NFATc4 levels. Aortic calcium accumulation is decreased in MAVS-deficient LDLR−/− mice fed arteriosclerotic diets. The G3BP1/RIG-I/MAVS relay is a component of Wnt signaling. Targeting this relay may help mitigate arteriosclerosis.",2018 May 25

Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral, diffuse, centrilobular ground-glass opacities and heterogeneous, high-density areas distributed throughout the lungs, predominantly in the upper and middle lobes. Unusually, in our patient the metastatic calcification coexisted with pulmonary metastases from renal cell carcinoma associated with end-stage renal disease. To our knowledge, such coexistence has not been previously described. Case report: CT, particularly high-resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT), plays an important role in detection and follow-up of MPC findings, which include ground-glass opacities and partially calcified nodules or consolidations, predominantly in the upper lung zones. Correct diagnosis is important because misdiagnosis may lead to improper or unnecessary treatment and/or procedures. Conclusions: MPC is a rare condition that results from calcium deposition in the normal pulmonary parenchyma. MPC commonly occurs in patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease due to abnormalities in calcium and phosphate metabolism. It is worth pointing out that despite the fact that the condition is called metastatic, it is a relatively benign lung disease with a generally good long-term prognosis.",2018

However, despite significant progress in recent genomic characterization, there are still tumors in this histologic spectrum that are difficult to classify, lacking known molecular characteristics. Triggered by a challenging congenital spindle cell neoplasm arising in the heel of a 1 year-old boy, we applied RNA sequencing for genetic discovery and identified a novel EWSR1-SMAD3 gene fusion. Based on the index case superficial acral location and fibroblastic appearance with a non-specific immunophenotype, we searched our files for similar cases and screened them by FISH for these abnormalities. Thus an identical EWSR1-SMAD3 fusion was identified in 2 additional spindle cell tumors with similar clinicopathological features. Both cases occurred in the feet of adult women (58 and 61 years old) and were characterized by distinctive nodular growth with zonation pattern of peripheral hypercellular areas arranged in short fascicles, transitioning to hypocellular central areas of hyalinization and infarction. Focal stippled calcification in the collagenous area was present in one case. All 3 tumors had similar immunoprofiles, being negative for SMA, CD34, CD31 and S100, but showing consistent ERG positivity of uncertain significance. Follow-up information was available in 2 patients who developed local recurrences after incomplete initial excisions, at 5 and 14 months, respectively. None developed metastatic disease. In summary, we report a group of locally recurrent superficial acral tumors, characterized by bland spindle cell fascicular growth, occasional zonation pattern, ERG positivity, and recurrent EWSR1-SMAD3 gene fusions.",2018 Apr

Emerging evidence indicates that vascular calcification is a process of active bone formation regulated by stimulators and inhibitors of calcification. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether six bone markers are associated with CVD risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: We used data of a case-cohort study, nested in the EPIC-NL cohort, comprising 134 CVD cases and a random subcohort of 218 participants, all with type 2 diabetes at baseline. Six bone markers (osteocalcin, osteopontin, osteonectin, osteoprotegerin, alkaline phosphatase and sclerostin) were measured in baseline plasma samples with multiplex assays and information on CVD events was obtained. The association of bone makers with CVD risk was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard analyses. Results: Higher concentrations of plasma osteopontin were associated (ptrend < 0.01) with an increased CVD risk with a hazard ratio of 2.00 (95%-CI 1.20–3.35) for the highest versus the lowest quartile in a multivariable adjusted model. The other bone markers were not associated with CVD risk. Conclusions: Higher osteopontin concentrations were associated with an increased CVD risk in type 2 diabetes patients. No consistent associations were found for the other five bone markers and risk of CVD in type 2 diabetes patients.

A total of 426 liver cancer patients treated in Yuhuangding Hospital (Yantai, China) from February 2011 to May 2016 were selected. Among them, 222 patients underwent CEUS examination, 204 patients underwent CT examination, and 102 patients underwent CEUS combined with CT examination. Sensitivity and specificity of the three methods were examined. CT showed a low density in 92.6% of patients (189 patients) and a high-low hybrid density in 6.4% (13 patients), with calcification seen in 2.5% of patients (5 patients) and bleeding in 3.4% (7 patients). Lesions: 76.5% (156 cases) of patients with multiple type, 23.5% (48 cases) with single type. CEUS showed overall enhancement in 53.2% patients (118 cases), heterogenous enhancement in 16.7% (37 cases), peripheral enhancement in 18.9% of patients (42 cases), necrosis of liquefaction in 11.3% (25 cases). In 65.3% (145 cases) of patients, the portal venous phase and the delayed phase showed a low enhancement, while 34.7% (77 cases) showed no enhancement. The sensitivity and specificity rates of CEUS combined with CT detection of liver cancer were 87.8, 88.2 and 94.1%, respectively. The ROC curve analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity of CEUS in the diagnosis of liver cancer were 76.8 and 78.9%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of CT were 81.2 and 85.5%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of CEUS combined with CT were 90.4 and 92.7%, respectively.

The interaction of valvular cells in advanced lesion environments is not well understood yet highly relevant as clinically detectable CAVD exhibits calcifications composed of non-stoichiometric hydroxyapatite (HA). In this study, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging was used to spatially analyze mineral properties as a function of disease progression. Crystallinity (size and perfection) increased with increased valve calcification. To study the relationship between crystallinity and cellular behavior in CAVD, valve cells were seeded into 3D mineral-rich collagen gels containing synthetic HA particles, which had varying crystallinities. Lower crystallinity HA drove myofibroblastic activation in both valve interstitial and endothelial cells, as well as osteoblastic differentiation in interstitial cells. Additionally, calcium accumulation within gels depended on crystallinity, and apoptosis was insufficient to explain differences in HA-driven cellular activity. The protective nature of endothelial cells against interstitial cell activation and calcium accumulation was completely inhibited in the presence of less crystalline HA particles. Elucidating valve cellular behavior post-calcification is of vital importance to better predict and treat clinical pathogenesis, and mineral-containing hydrogel models provide a unique 3D platform to evaluate valve cell responses to a later stage of valve disease.",2018 Apr 15

Alizarin red staining, von kossa staining, calcein fluorescence staining and ALP activity detection were used to identify mineralization in calcification model of ovarian cancer. Also, the changes of ultrastructure and the mineralization biomarkers after the induction of calcification medium were investigated by transmission electron microscopy and western blot, respectively. The SKOV3 cells migration behavior after the induction of calcification medium was evaluated by using transwell assay and scratch wound. Finally, mineralization biomarkers were verified in 40 cases of calcified ovarian cancer specimens and matched 40 non-calcified ovarian cancer tissues.Results: Classical calcium salt detection methods confirmed that the culture of SKOV3 cells in calcification medium was an appropriate ovarian cancer calcification model in vitro. Transmission electron microscopy and western blot revealed respectively the presence of cells with morphological characteristics of osteoblasts and the upregulation of mineralization biomarkers expression in treatment group. Transwell assay and scratch wound showed the decreased SKOV3 cell migration in treatment group. In specimens, the calcification occurred predominantly in well-differentiated carcinomas and the expression of the BMP2 and OPN elevated in calcified group.Conclusion: Our study showed that the switch of the ovarian cancer cell to a calcifying phenotype in the formation of calcification in ovarian cancer.

Methods:: An observer study was carried out in which mammograms were read using full field views only, and again with the additional use of magnified quadrant views. Seven observers read 300 cases, one view per breast, using each display type. Cases comprised 100 normal cases and 200 cases with cancers of subtle or very subtle appearance: 100 with malignant calcification clusters and 100 with non-calcified lesions. JAFROC software was used to analyse the results. Results:: When mammograms were viewed full field only, observers performed better (p = 0.050) in detecting malignant calcification clusters when using the pair of 5MP monitors compared with a single 8MP monitor. This result became non-significant when results were generalised to a population of readers. Performance in detecting calcification clusters was improved by using quadrant view in addition to full field view when using either the pair of 5MP monitors or the 8MP monitor. There was no significant difference in detection of all types of cancer between the pair of 5MP monitors and the 8MP monitor when quadrant zoom was used. Conclusion:: Providing quadrant view is used in addition to full field view, there is no significant difference in cancer detection between the 8MP monitor and the pair of 5MP monitors.

We have previously reported that activation of AKT by oxidative stress induces vascular calcification. Using sodium dichloroacetate (DCA), a previously reported small molecule inhibitor of AKT, the present studies uncovered an AKT-independent mechanism in regulating vascular calcification.We found that DCA dose-dependently induced calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in vitro and aortic rings ex vivo. Furthermore, DCA markedly enhanced vascular calcification in atherosclerotic ApoE knockout mice in vivo. DCA-induced VSMC calcification was associated with increased Runx2, but not via activation of AKT, a key upstream signal that upregulates Runx2 during VSMC calcification. In contrast, DCA inhibited AKT activation and induced activation of p38 MAPK in calcified atherosclerotic lesions in vivo and calcified VSMC in vitro. Using a pharmacological inhibitor and shRNA for p38 MAPK, we demonstrated that inhibition of p38 MAPK blocked DCA-induced Runx2 upregulation and VSMC calcification. Furthermore, Runx2 deletion attenuated DCA-induced VSMC calcification. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed association of p38 MAPK with Runx2, which was enhanced by DCA treatment. Knockdown p38 MAPK inhibited DCA-induced Runx2 transactivity, supporting the function of p38 MAPK in regulating Runx2 transactivity.Our studies have uncovered a new function of DCA in regulating vascular calcification, via AKT-independent activation of p38 MAPK. Furthermore, we have identified novel interaction between p38 MAPK and Runx2 enhances Runx2 transactivity, thus promoting VSMC calcification. These results revealed a novel signaling mechanism underlying DCA-induced vascular calcification, and offer opportunities to identify new therapeutic targets.",2018 Jun

Cardiovascular risk factor stratification is important to predict short term cardiac events during cancer therapy and long term cardiac event free survival in cancer patients. We sought to determine the prevalence of CAC and clinical reporting rates in a cohort of cancer patients at high risk of cancer therapy related cardiac events. Methods: 408 Breast cancer patients who were referred to a cardiac oncology clinic were screened. Inclusion criteria included having had a CT chest and the absence of known coronary disease. Among those screened 263 patients were included in the study. Results: CAC was identified in 70 patients (26%). CAC was reported in 18% of studies. The reporting rates of CAC increased with the extent of coronary calcification (p < 0.01) and increased during the period of the study (p < 0.05). Conclusions: CAC was commonly detected on chest CT studies in this observational study of breast cancer patients at high risk of cardiac oncology events. The presence of CAC was often not reported clinically but reporting rates have increased over time. Recent SCCT/STR guidelines recommend reporting the presence of CAC on routine chest CT scans in recognition of the importance of CAC as a predictor of cardiovascular events. Reporting of CAC on chest CTs may help to further risk stratify breast cancer patients and improve cardiovascular outcomes in this vulnerable population.,2018 Mar

We consider a class of semiparametric transformation cure models for current status data with a survival fraction. This class includes both the proportional hazards and the proportional odds cure models as two special cases. We develop efficient likelihood-based estimation and inference procedures. We show that the maximum likelihood estimators for the regression coefficients are consistent, asymptotically normal, and asymptotically efficient. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed methods perform well in finite samples. For illustration, we provide an application of the models to a study on the calcification of the hydrogel intraocular lenses.",2019 Jan

Most importantly, it is responsible for maintaining the balanced ratio of phosphate and inorganic pyrophosphate, thus regulates the extracellular matrix calcification during bone formation and growth. The elevated level of TNAP has been linked to vascular calcification and end-stage renal diseases. Consequently, there is a need to search for highly potent and selective inhibitors of alkaline phosphatases (APs) for treatment of disorders associated with the over-expression of APs. Herein, a series of tricyclic coumarin sulphonate 1a-za with known antiproliferative activity, was evaluated for AP inhibition against human tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (h-TNAP) and human intestinal alkaline phosphatase (h-IAP). The methylbenzenesulphonate derivative 1f (IC50 = 0.38 ± 0.01 μM) was found to be the most active h-TNAP inhibitor. Another 4-fluorobenzenesulphonate derivative 1i (IC50 = 0.45 ± 0.02 μM) was found as the strongest inhibitor of h-IAP. Some of the derivatives were also identified as highly selective inhibitors of APs. Detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) was investigated to identify the functional groups responsible for the effective inhibition of AP isozymes. The study was also supported by the docking studies to rationalise the most possible binding site interactions of the identified inhibitors with the targeted enzymes.",2018

This state-of-the-art review paper highlights the potential gain in information that can be obtained from the non-contrast coronary calcium scans without any necessary modifications to the scan protocol. This includes markers of cardio-metabolic health, such as the amount of epicardial fat and liver fat, but also markers of general health including bone density and lung density. Finally, this paper addresses the importance of incidental findings and of radiation exposure accompanying imaging with non-contrast cardiac computed tomography. Despite the fact that coronary calcium scan protocols have been optimized for the visualization of coronary calcification in terms image quality and radiation exposure, it is important for radiologists, cardiologists and medical specialists in the field of preventive medicine to acknowledge that numerous additional markers of cardio-metabolic health and general health can be readily identified on a coronary calcium scan. Key Points: • The coronary artery calcium score substantially increased the use of cardiac CT.• Cardio-metabolic and general health markers may be derived without changes to the scan protocol.• Those include epicardial fat, aortic valve calcifications, liver fat, bone density, and lung density.• Clinicians must be aware of this potential additional yield from non-contrast cardiac CT.",2018
425,"Itoh S,Mizuno K,Aikawa M,Aikawa E",Dimerization of sortilin regulates its trafficking to extracellular vesicles.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a critical role in intercellular communication by transferring microRNAs, lipids, and proteins to neighboring cells. Sortilin, a sorting receptor that directs target proteins to the secretory or endocytic compartments of cells, is found in both EVs and cells. In many human diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disorders, sortilin expression levels are atypically high. To elucidate the relationship between cardiovascular disease, particularly vascular calcification, and sortilin expression levels, we explored the trafficking of sortilin in both the intracellular and extracellular milieu. We previously demonstrated that sortilin promotes vascular calcification via its trafficking of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase to EVs. Although recent reports have noted that sortilin is regulated by multiple post-translational modifications, the precise mechanisms of sortilin trafficking still need to be determined. Here, we show that sortilin forms homodimers with an intermolecular disulfide bond at the cysteine 783 (Cys783) residue, and because Cys783 can be palmitoylated, it could be shared via palmitoylation and an intermolecular disulfide bond. Formation of this intermolecular disulfide bond leads to trafficking of sortilin to EVs by preventing palmitoylation, which further promotes sortilin trafficking to the Golgi apparatus. Moreover, we found that sortilin-derived propeptide decreased sortilin homodimers within EVs. In conclusion, sortilin is transported to EVs via the formation of homodimers with an intermolecular disulfide bond, which is endogenously regulated by its own propeptide. Therefore, we propose that inhibiting dimerization of sortilin acts as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of EV-associated diseases, including vascular calcification and cancer.",2018 Mar 23

Iron overload induces several complications, including the acceleration of arteriosclerosis. However, the relationship between Moenckeberg’s arteriosclerosis in vascular smooth muscle cells and iron accumulation has remained unknown. We tested the accelerated effect of iron on calcification in cultured human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). After establishment of this model, we performed a microarray analysis using mRNA from early stage culture HASMCs after iron stimulation with or without TNF-alpha stimulation. The role of interleukin-24 (IL-24) was confirmed from candidate genes that might contribute to calcification. HASMCs demonstrated calcification induced by iron and TNF-alpha. Calcification of HASMCs was synergistically enhanced by stimulation with both iron and TNF-alpha. In the early phase of calcification, microarray analysis revealed up-regulation of IL-24. Stimulation of HASMCs by IL-24 instead of iron induced calcification. The anti-IL-24 antibody reversed the effect of IL-24, supporting the important role of IL-24 in HASMCs calcification. In conclusion, iron-induced calcification in vascular smooth muscle cells occurred via IL-24, IL-24 was increased during the calcification process induced by iron, and IL-24 itself caused calcification in the absence of iron.",2018

Its dysfunctional form, desphospho-uncarboxylated-MGP, has been associated with increased arterial calcification and stiffness. The aim of this study was to measure the degree of postoperative carboxylation of MGP and two other Gla proteins in patients scheduled for abdominal or orthopaedic surgery. Methods: Forty patients undergoing abdominal or orthopaedic surgery were included. Blood samples were collected preoperatively and four days after the surgery. Desphospho-carboxylated MGP (dp-cMGP), desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), carboxylated osteocalcin (OC) (cOC), uncarboxylated OC (ucOC), and uncarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II) were analysed. Results: Preoperatively, 29 patients had dp-ucMGP levels above the reference values. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities had higher dp-ucMGP preoperatively compared with patients with no record of cardiovascular disease. Postoperatively, this number increased to 36 patients, and median dp-ucMGP levels increased (p < 0.0001) and correlated to a PIVKA-II increase (r = 0.44). On the other hand, dp-cMGP levels did not significantly alter. Decreased levels of ucOC and cOC were seen after surgery (p = 0.017 and p = 0.0033, respectively). Comorbidities, possible nutritional defects, and complications affecting Gla protein activity and function were identified. Conclusions.

The pathogenetic mechanism of RCCT is still unclear. It seems to be related to cell-mediated disease in which metaplastic transformation of tenocytes into chondrocytes induces calcification inside the tendon of the RC. RCCT is a frequent finding in the RC that may cause significant shoulder pain and disability. It can be easily diagnosed with imaging studies as conventional radiography (CR) or ultrasound (US). Conservative management of RCCT usually involves rest, physical therapy, and oral NSAIDs administration. Imaging-guided treatments are currently considered minimally-invasive, yet effective methods to treat RCCT with about 80% success rate. Surgery remains the most invasive treatment option in chronic cases that fail to improve with other less invasive approaches. (www.actabiomedica.it)",2018
431,"Hazarika M,Mahanta LB",A New Breast Border Extraction and Contrast Enhancement Technique with Digital Mammogram Images for Improved Detection of Breast Cancer.,"Purpose:: Breast cancer can be cured if diagnosed early, with digital mammography which is one of the most effective imaging modalities for early detection. However mammogram images often come with low contrast, high background noises and artifacts, making diagnosis difficult. The purpose of this research is to preprocess mammogram images to improve results with a computer aided diagnosis system. The focus is on three preprocessing methods: a breast border segmentation method; a contrast enhancement method; and a pectoral muscle removal method. Methods:: The proposed breast border extraction method employs a threshold based segmentation technique along with a combination of morphological operations. The contrast enhancement method presented here is divided into two phages. In phase I, a bi-level histogram modification technique is applied to enhance the image globally and in phase II a non-linear filter based on local mean and local standard deviation for each pixel is applied to the histogram modified image. The pectoral muscle removal method discussed here is implemented by applying a region growing algorithm. Results:: The proposed techniques are tested with the Mini MIAS dataset. The breast border extraction method is applied to 322 images and achieved 98.7% segmentation accuracy. The contrast enhancement method is evaluated based on quantitative measures like measure of enhancement, absolute mean brightness error, combined enhancement measure and discrete entropy. The proposed contrast enhancement method when applied to 14 images with different types of masses, the quantitative measures showed an optimum level of contrast enhancement compared to other enhancement methods with preservation of local detail. Removal of the pectoral muscle from MLO mammogram images reduced the search region while identifying abnormalities like masses and calcification. Conclusions:: The preprocessing steps proposed here show promising results in terms of both qualitative and quantitative analysis.",2018
432,"Kundu ZS,Sen R,Dhiman A,Sharma P,Siwach R,Rana P",Effect of Intravenous Zoledronic Acid on Histopathology and Recurrence after Extended Curettage in Giant Cell Tumors of Bone: A Comparative Prospective Study.,"Background:: Giant cell tumor (GCT) of the bone is known for its locally aggressive behavior and tendency to recur. It is an admixture of rounded or spindle-shaped mononuclear neoplastic stromal cells and multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells with their proportionate dispersion among the former. Zoledronic acid (a bisphosphonate) is being used in various cancers such as myelomas and metastasis, for osteoporosis with an aim to reduce the resorption of bone, and as an adjuvant treatment for the management of GCT of bone for reduction of local recurrence. We have carried out a prospective comparative study to assess the effect of intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid on histopathology and recurrence of GCT of bone. Materials and Methods:: The study was carried out in the biopsy proven GCTs in 37 patients; 15 males and 22 females, in the age range from 17 to 55 years. They were treated with extended curettage. Of these 37 patients, 18 were given three doses of 4 mg zoledronic acid infusion at 3-week intervals and extended curettage was performed 2 weeks after the last infusion whereas the other 19 were treated with extended curettage without zoledronic infusion. The post infusion histopathology of the curetted material was compared with the histopathology of initial biopsy. All the patients were evaluated at 3-month intervals for the first 2 years and then six monthly thereafter, for local recurrence and functional outcome of limb using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score. Results:: In postzoledronic infusion cases, the histopathology of samples showed abnormal stromal cells secreting matrix leading to fibrosis and calcification. The type of fibrosis and calcification was different from pathological calcification and fibrosis what is usually observed. There was a good marginalization and solidification of tumors which made surgical curettage easier in six cases in the study group. There was noticeable reduction in the number of giant cells and alteration in morphology of stromal cells to the fibroblastic-fibrocytic series type in comparison to preinfusion histopathology. Recurrence occurred in one case out of 18 patients in infusion group whereas in four cases among 19 patients in control group. The functional results were assessed, and the overall average MSTS score was 27.50 (range 24–30) and 27.00 (range 23.50–30) in the study and control groups, respectively. Conclusions:: We observed that bisphosphonates reduce osteoclast activity and affects stromal cells in GCT, resulting in the reduction of their numbers and noticeable apoptosis. This results in better marginalization of the lesions and reduced recurrence. Extended curettage of friable GCT became easier and adequate which otherwise might not have been possible.",2018 Jan-Feb
433,"Miyauchi A,Ito Y,Oda H",Insights into the Management of Papillary Microcarcinoma of the Thyroid.,"Background: Rapid increases in the incidence of thyroid carcinoma with stable mortality rates from thyroid carcinoma have been reported from many countries, and these increases are thought to be due mostly to the increased detection of small papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), including papillary microcarcinomas (PMCs; i.e., PTCs ≤10 mm). Some researchers have suggested that small PTCs have been overdiagnosed and overtreated. In Japan, the active surveillance of patients with low-risk PMCs was initiated by Kuma Hospital (1993) and Tokyo's Cancer Institute Hospital (1995) based on the extremely higher incidences of both latent thyroid carcinomas in autopsy studies and small PTCs detected in mass screening studies using ultrasound examinations compared to the prevalence of clinical thyroid carcinomas.Methods: The above two institutions' data are summarized regarding the active surveillance of low-risk PMCs, and future prospects for their management are discussed.Results: At 10-year observations in the Kuma Hospital series of 1235 patients, only 8% and 3.8% of the PMC patients showed size enlargement by ≥3 mm and the novel appearance of node metastasis, respectively. In contrast to clinical PTC, PMCs are most unlikely to grow in older patients (≥60 years). In the Kuma Hospital series, the 974 patients who underwent immediate surgery had significantly higher incidences of unfavorable events than the 1179 patients who chose active surveillance. The total cost of immediate surgery, including the costs for salvage surgery and postoperative care for 10 years, was 4.1 times the total cost of 10-year management by active surveillance. Only 8% of the 51 PMC patients showed tumor enlargement during pregnancy, and the rescue surgeries after delivery were successful. In the Cancer Institute Hospital series of 230 patients with 300 lesions, only 7% and 1% of the patients showed size enlargement and novel node metastasis, respectively, and that institution's analysis also revealed that macroscopic or rim calcification and poor vascularity were correlated with non-progressing disease. In both series, none of the patients who underwent rescue surgery after progression signs were detected showed significant recurrence or died of PTC.Conclusion: Active surveillance of low-risk PMC can be the first-line management. Interestingly, older patients with low-risk PMCs are the best candidates for active surveillance.",2018 Jan 01
434,"Jansen F,Li Q,Pfeifer A,Werner N",Endothelial- and Immune Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles in the Regulation of Cardiovascular Health and Disease.,"Intercellular signaling by extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a route of cell-cell crosstalk that allows cells to deliver biological messages to specific recipient cells. EVs convey these messages through their distinct cargoes consisting of cytokines, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which they transport from the donor cell to the recipient cell. In cardiovascular disease (CVD), endothelial- and immune cell-derived EVs are emerging as key players in different stages of disease development. EVs can contribute to atherosclerosis development and progression by promoting endothelial dysfunction, intravascular calcification, unstable plaque progression, and thrombus formation after rupture. In contrast, an increasing body of evidence highlights the beneficial effects of certain EVs on vascular function and endothelial regeneration. However, the effects of EVs in CVD are extremely complex and depend on the cellular origin, the functional state of the releasing cells, the biological content, and the diverse recipient cells. This paper summarizes recent progress in our understanding of EV signaling in cardiovascular health and disease and its emerging potential as a therapeutic agent.",2017 Dec

Osteoblasts play crucial roles in bone formation. However, osteoblast functions are influenced by mitochondrial bioenergetic conditions. In this study, we investigated the roles of the estrogen and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) axis in mitochondrial energy metabolism and subsequent osteoblast mineralization. Exposure of rat calvarial osteoblasts to estradiol caused substantial improvements in alkaline phosphatase activities and cell calcification. In parallel, treatment of human osteoblast-like U2OS cells, derived from a female osteosarcoma patient, with estradiol specifically augmented ERα levels. Sequentially, estradiol stimulated translocation of ERα to nuclei in human osteoblasts and induced expressions of genomic respiratory chain complex NDUFA10, UQCRC1, cytochrome c oxidase (COX)8A, COX6A2, COX8C, COX6C, COX6B2, COX412, and ATP12A genes. Concurrently, estradiol stimulated translocation of ERα to mitochondria from the cytoplasm. A bioinformatic search found the existence of four estrogen response elements in the 5’-promoter region of the mitochondrial cox i gene. Interestingly, estradiol induced COX I mRNA and protein expressions in human osteoblasts or rat calvarial osteoblasts. Knocking-down ERα translation concurrently downregulated estradiol-induced COX I mRNA expression. Consequently, exposure to estradiol led to successive increases in the mitochondrial membrane potential, the mitochondrial enzyme activity, and cellular adenosine triphosphate levels. Taken together, this study showed the roles of the estradiol/ERα signaling axis in improving osteoblast maturation through upregulating the mitochondrial bioenergetic system due to induction of definite chromosomal and mitochondrial complex gene expressions. Our results provide novel insights elucidating the roles of the estrogen/ERα alliance in regulating bone formation.",2018 Jan 2
436,"Lee RS,Gimenez F,Hoogi A,Miyake KK,Gorovoy M,Rubin DL",A curated mammography data set for use in computer-aided detection and diagnosis research.,"Published research results are difficult to replicate due to the lack of a standard evaluation data set in the area of decision support systems in mammography; most computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) algorithms for breast cancer in mammography are evaluated on private data sets or on unspecified subsets of public databases. This causes an inability to directly compare the performance of methods or to replicate prior results. We seek to resolve this substantial challenge by releasing an updated and standardized version of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) for evaluation of future CADx and CADe systems (sometimes referred to generally as CAD) research in mammography. Our data set, the CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM), includes decompressed images, data selection and curation by trained mammographers, updated mass segmentation and bounding boxes, and pathologic diagnosis for training data, formatted similarly to modern computer vision data sets. The data set contains 753 calcification cases and 891 mass cases, providing a data-set size capable of analyzing decision support systems in mammography.",2017

A total of 525 pathological thyroid nodules were retrospectively analyzed. All the nodules underwent conventional ultrasonography (US), strain elastosonography (SE), and contrast -enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Those nodules’ 12 suspicious sonographic features were used to assess thyroid nodules. The significant features of diagnosing thyroid nodules were picked out by logistic regression analysis. All variables that were statistically related to diagnosis of thyroid nodules, at a level of p < 0.05 were embodied in a logistic regression analysis model. The significant features in the logistic regression model of diagnosing thyroid nodules were calcification, suspected cervical lymph node metastasis, hypoenhancement pattern, margin, shape, vascularity, posterior acoustic, echogenicity, and elastography score. According to the results of logistic regression analysis, the formula that could predict whether or not thyroid nodules are malignant was established. The area under the receiver operating curve (ROC) was 0.930 and the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 83.77%, 89.56%, 87.05%, 86.04%, and 87.79% respectively.",2017
439,"Shida M,Chiba A,Ohashi M,Yamakawa M",Ultrasound Diagnosis and Treatment of Breast Lumps after Breast Augmentation with Autologous Fat Grafting.,"Background:: Breast augmentation with autologous fat has been performed in Japan for over 30 years. However, complications include breast lumps and oil cysts. Such breast lumps greatly reduce patient satisfaction, and are currently difficult to diagnose and treat for many cosmetic surgery clinics. This study aimed to elucidate the effectiveness of ultrasound diagnosis and treatment of patients with breast lumps after breast augmentation with autologous fat grafting. Methods:: We used diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound to examine 256 patients with breast lumps between April 2012 and April 2017. We determined the nature, size, and location of the maximal lump. Breast lumps were classified into five types: cystic, complex, solid, calcification, and unclassifiable. The method of treatment (including fine-needle aspiration, VASER liposuction, lumpectomy, and extended lumpectomy) was selected according to the lump type, and the efficacy of treatment was determined by postoperative palpation and ultrasound. Results:: A total of 198 patients (198/256, 77%) requested treatment. Cystic lumps (79/256, 31%) were treated by fine-needle aspiration. VASER liposuction was used to treat complex (64/256, 25%) and solid lumps (50/256, 19%). Calcification (58/256, 23%) and unclassifiable lumps (5/256, 2%) were removed via periareolar incision. There were no serious complications. In all cases, the lumps were no longer palpable after treatment, and ultrasound showed that they had either contracted or disappeared. Conclusions:: The appropriate treatment for breast lumps after breast augmentation with autologous fat grafting must be selected according to the nature of the lumps. Ultrasound is essential for diagnosing the breast lump type and determining the best treatment.",2017 Dec

Objective: Retrospective analysis of data from breast cancer patients with thyroid metastasis (TM). Methods: The US suspected, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) confirmed TM in breast cancer patients, treated between 2005 and 2015 at our hospital, was retrospectively analyzed. The data were re-evaluated by the pathologist and radiologist who were blinded to the patients' data. Results: FNAC and immunohistochemistry confirmed the ultrasonography (US) suspected TM in eight breast cancer patients. Clinically both unilateral and bilateral TM was seen, which were symptomless and metachronously (6–121 months) metastasized. Six of eight cases exhibited recurrence/distant metastasis and were treated with chemotherapy/thyroidectomy of which two cases passed away. The remaining two patients had no recurrences/distant metastases and were treated with partial/total thyroidectomy. Post-chemotherapy US showed more homogenous thyroid parenchyma with gathering of calcification that reduced in size, revealing the sensitiveness of TM to chemotherapy. Conclusion: US was useful in screening TM in breast cancer patients. Both partial and total thyroidectomy was effective in disease free survival of isolated TM cases, with controlled primary condition. TM responded well to chemotherapy in most of the recurrent breast cancer cases with or without distant metastasis.",2017 Dec
441,"Namazi A,Adibi A,Haghighi M,Hashemi M",An Evaluation of Ultrasound Features of Breast Fibroadenoma.,"Background:: Breast cancer is among the most common cancers in the world. Ultrasound evaluations of breast have come into attention as an alternative route. Ultrasound features of benign lesions such as fibroadenoma can be overlapping with those in a malignant tumor. Here, we assessed the reports of breast ultrasound in patients with pathologic diagnosis of fibroadenoma. Materials and Methods:: We conducted a cross-sectional study and enrolled female patients with confirmed histologic diagnosis of fibroadenoma. Ultrasound studies were performed on the participants to see which sonographic patterns are more frequent in such lesions. Results:: In 92 patients with 40.4 ± 9.2 years of age, all participants were classified as stage 4 on Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System scale. The mean ± standard deviation of size for the lesions was 167.4 ± 101.4 mm2. Upper outer quadrants in the breasts had the most number of lesions. Almost lesions were round with only 2.2% were oval. When assessed for the margin definition, 57.8% were circumscribed. Noncircumscribed masses were reported in 21.7%. About 91.3% of cases were hypoechoic in the ultrasound evaluation. Lobulated masses were in 28.3% of the cases. 8.7% of the masses were spongy whereas 9.8% and 2.2% of them had calcification and heterogenic appearance, respectively. Conclusion:: The most frequent features include a hypoechoic mass with a circumscribed border; however, complex presentations that overlap malignant masses are also detectable including noncircumscribed margin, lobulation, presence of a posterior shadow, heterogenicity, and micro calcification.",2017
442,"Morris TG,Borland SJ,Clarke CJ,Wilson C,Hannun YA,Ohanian V,Canfield AE,Ohanian J",Sphingosine 1-phosphate activation of ERM contributes to vascular calcification[S].,"Vascular calcification is the deposition of mineral in the artery wall by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in response to pathological stimuli. The process is similar to bone formation and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Given that ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are involved in cardiovascular pathophysiology and biomineralization, their role in VSMC matrix mineralization was investigated. During phosphate-induced VSMC mineralization, endogenous S1P levels increased accompanied by increased sphingosine kinase (SK) activity and increased mRNA expression of SK1 and SK2. Consistent with this, mineralization was increased by exogenous S1P, but decreased by C2-ceramide. Mechanistically, exogenous S1P stimulated ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) phosphorylation in VSMCs and ERM phosphorylation was increased concomitantly with endogenous S1P during mineralization. Moreover, inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase and ceramidase with desipramine prevented increased S1P levels, ERM activation, and mineralization. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of ERM phosphorylation with NSC663894 decreased mineralization induced by phosphate and exogenous S1P. Although further studies will be needed to verify these findings in vivo, this study defines a novel role for the SK-S1P-ERM pathways in phosphate-induced VSMC matrix mineralization and shows that blocking these pathways with pharmacological inhibitors reduces mineralization. These results may inform new therapeutic approaches to inhibit or delay vascular calcification.",2018 Jan

In this study, quantitative multiscale correlative maps of structural, elemental and biochemical properties of whole medullo-papillary complexes from human kidneys were developed. Correlative maps of properties specific to the uriniferous and vascular tubules using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and immunolocalization of noncollagenous proteins (NCPs) along with their association with anatomy specific biominerals were obtained. Results illustrated that intratubular spherical aggregates primarily form at the proximal regions distant from the papillary tip while interstitial spherical and fibrillar aggregates are distally located near the papillary tip. Biominerals at the papillary tip were closely localized with 10 to 50 μm diameter vasa recta immunolocalized for CD31 inside the medullo-papillary complex. Abundant NCPs known to regulate bone mineralization were localized within nanoparticles, forming early pathologic mineralized regions of the complex. Based on the physical association between vascular and urothelial tubules, results from light and electron microscopy techniques suggested that these NCPs could be delivered from vasculature to prompt calcification of the interstitial regions or they might be synthesized from local vascular smooth muscle cells after transdifferentiation into osteoblast-like phenotypes. In addition, results provided insights into the plausible temporal events that link the anatomically specific intratubular mineral aggregates with the interstitial biomineralization processes within the functional unit of the kidney.",2017

We hypothesized that GA controls hypertension via oxidative stress response regulation in an animal model for essential hypertension. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were administered GA for 16 weeks. GA treatment lowered elevated systolic blood pressure in SHRs through the inhibition of vascular contractility and components of the renin-angiotensin II system. In addition, GA administration reduced aortic wall thickness and body weight in SHRs. In SHRs, GA attenuated left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced the expression of cardiac-specific transcription factors. NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) and GATA4 mRNA expression was induced in SHR hearts and angiotensin II-treated H9c2 cells; this expression was downregulated by GA treatment. Nox2 promoter activity was increased by the synergistic action of GATA4 and Nkx2-5. GA seems to regulate oxidative stress by inhibiting the DNA binding activity of GATA4 in the rat Nox2 promoter. GA reduced the GATA4-induced Nox activity in SHRs and angiotensin II-treated H9c2 cells. GA administration reduced the elevation of malondialdehyde levels in heart tissue obtained from SHRs. These findings suggest that GA is a potential therapeutic agent for treating cardiac hypertrophy and oxidative stress in SHRs.",2017

We report the case of a 43-year-old female haemodialysis patient who developed calciphylaxis. Two months prior to the diagnosis she was found to have an undetectable plasma vitamin K concentration. The calciphylaxis completely resolved with vitamin K supplementation and an increase in haemodialysis frequency. She did not receive sodium thiosulphate or bisphosphonates.

Although the mechanisms regulating early calcium deposition are not fully understood, they may provide targets for new treatments and for early interventions. Here, we show that two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) can provide quantitative and sensitive readouts of calcific nodule formation, in particular in the context of CAVD. Specifically, by means of the decomposition of TPEF spectral images from excised human CAVD valves and from rat bone prior to and following demineralization, as well as from calcific nodules formed within engineered gels, we identified an endogenous fluorophore that correlates with the level of mineralization in the samples. We then developed a ratiometric imaging approach that provides a quantitative readout of the presence of mineral deposits in early calcifications. TPEF should enable non-destructive, high-resolution imaging of three-dimensional tissue specimens for the assessment of the presence of calcification.",2017 Nov

Methods: From a screening cohort of 63,895 women, exams were collected from 59,690 women without any abnormalities, 744 women with a screen-detected cancer and a prior negative exam, 781 women with a false positive exam based on calcifications, and 413 women with an interval cancer. A radiologist identified cancer-related calcifications, selected by a computer-aided detection system, on mammograms taken prior to screen-detected or interval cancer diagnoses. Using this ground truth and the pathology reports, the sensitivity for calcification detection and the proportion of lesions with visible calcifications that developed into invasive cancer were determined. Results: The screening sensitivity for calcifications was 45.5%, at a specificity of 99.5%. A total of 68.4% (n = 177) of cancer-related calcifications that could have been detected earlier were associated with invasive cancer when diagnosed. Conclusions: Screening sensitivity for detection of malignant calcifications is low. Improving the detection of these early signs of cancer is important, because the majority of lesions with detectable calcifications that are not recalled immediately but detected as interval cancer or in the next screening round are invasive at the time of diagnosis.",2018

However, the correlation between PD-L1/PD-1 expression and the specific clinicopathological features in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has not been investigated. Methods: We examined the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1, PD-1, and BRAF V600E on whole-tissue sections from 126 cases of primary PTC more than 1 cm in size. The correlation between the PD-L1/PD-1 expression and the clinicopathological features was evaluated. Results: PD-L1 was positively expressed in 53.2% PTCs, and its expression was positively correlated with rich tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), background chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT), female gender, absence of psammoma bodies, and PD-1 expression. Among these parameters, rich TILs, female gender, and absence of psammoma bodies were independent factors affecting PD-L1 expression on the multivariate logistic regression analysis. PD-1 expression was detected in the TILs and was positively correlated with rich TILs, background CLT, and absence of stromal calcification. Lack of stromal calcification was an independent factor affecting PD-1 expression. Neither PD-L1 nor PD-1 expression showed significant correlation with BRAF V600E expression. Conclusions: Our results show that the distinctive pathological features of PTCs, including TILs, background CLT, female gender, psammoma bodies, and stromal calcification, are useful parameters for predicting PD-L1 or PD-1 expression.",2017

Successive cycles of dental plaque growth and calcification make it an unusually well-preserved, long-term record of host-microbial interaction in the archaeological record. Recent studies have confirmed the survival of authentic ancient DNA and proteins within historic and prehistoric dental calculus, making it a promising substrate for investigating oral microbiome evolution via direct measurement and comparison of modern and ancient specimens. Objective: We present the first comprehensive characterization of the human dental calculus metabolome using a multi-platform approach. Methods: Ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) quantified 285 metabolites in modern and historic (200 years old) dental calculus, including metabolites of drug and dietary origin. A subset of historic samples was additionally analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography–MS (GC–MS) and UPLC–MS/MS for further characterization of metabolites and lipids. Metabolite profiles of modern and historic calculus were compared to identify patterns of persistence and loss. Results: Dipeptides, free amino acids, free nucleotides, and carbohydrates substantially decrease in abundance and ubiquity in archaeological samples, with some exceptions. Lipids generally persist, and saturated and mono-unsaturated medium and long chain fatty acids appear to be well-preserved, while metabolic derivatives related to oxidation and chemical degradation are found at higher levels in archaeological dental calculus than fresh samples. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that certain metabolite classes have higher potential for recovery over long time scales and may serve as appropriate targets for oral microbiome evolutionary studies.

Sclerosing thymoma is also an extremely rare anterior mediastinal tumor, pathologically characterized by extensive sclerotic lesions with hyalinization and calcification. Only 14 cases of sclerosing thymoma and five cases of thymic amyloidosis have been reported to date. Case presentation: A 78-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed as having sclerosing thymoma (Masaoka stage IVa pericardial dissemination)-like thymic amyloidoma. She was diagnosed as having either lung cancer or mediastinal tumor with pericardial dissemination, and received palliative treatment. Three years later, she was readmitted with a complaint of general malaise. Since minimal change nephrotic syndrome was suspected based on the disease onset and selectivity index of urinary protein, steroid pulse therapy was started. Subsequently, because a marked reduction in tumor size was observed during maintenance treatment with prednisolone, a thoracoscopic needle biopsy was performed for a definitive diagnosis. According to the pathological findings and clinical investigations, a final diagnosis of sclerosing thymoma (Masaoka stage IVa pericardial dissemination)-like thymic amyloidoma was made. Conclusions: This is a case report of sclerosing thymoma-like thymic amyloidoma. Both sclerosing thymoma and thymic amyloidoma are extremely rare diseases: only 14 cases of sclerosing thymoma and five cases of thymic amyloidosis have been reported to date. In either diagnosis, our case is the first case in which marked reduction in tumor size was observed with steroid therapy. All reported cases of sclerosing thymomas underwent surgical resection, but steroid therapy to sclerosing thymoma has not been reported. It is still unknown whether steroid therapy is effective or not. The hyalinized components of sclerosing thymoma possibly contain amyloid deposits. The marked reduction in tumor size with steroid therapy may result in amyloid deposits. The association between sclerosing thymoma and thymic amyloidoma remains uncertain.

451,"Joshi P,Sharma R",Benign Lesions on Screening Mammography: Increasing Diagnostic Confidence in a Hitherto Unscreened Population.,"Introduction: Screening mammography is used for detection of breast cancer and is interpreted using the Breast Image Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) convention. It is not routinely offered to women in countries which do not have a national screening programme resulting in a challenge for the radiologist who has to interpret these in the absence of previous mammograms. Aim: To analyse benign and probably benign lesions in screening mammograms in a hitherto unscreened population and suggest protocols to increase diagnostic confidence. Materials and Methods: Screening mammograms of 362 asymptomatic women in the age range of 40 to 60 years carried out over a two year period were retrospectively analysed. Patients of breast cancer and those who had palpable lumps were excluded from the study. All images were analysed in standard Mediolateral Oblique (MLO) and Craniocaudal (CC) projections with additional views wherever necessary. Corroborative ultrasound had been carried out wherever indicated in the opinion of the interpreting radiologist. The mammograms were finally classified according to the BIRADS convention. Results: Of the total number of 362 women screened, most of whom did not have any previous mammogram, 162 were reported as BIRADS I, 179 as BIRADS II and 18 as BIRADS III. The mammograms reported as BIRADS II had various findings including dystrophic calcification/macrocalcification, vascular calcification, simple cysts and fibroadenomas. Only 26 (16.04%) of the BIRADS I mammograms had undergone further evaluation with Ultrasound (US) due to dense breasts or asymmetrical involution of breast tissue whereas 76 (42.5%) of the BIRADS II mammograms had undergone further evaluation with US to characterize lesions like cysts and fibroadenomas, but occasionally also for benign clustered calcification. Of BIRADS III mammograms, 12 (66.6%) had required US correlation to exclude a mass in cases with dense breasts. The increased likelihood of ultrasound corroboration in BIRADS II and BIRADS III was analysed using the Chi square test and was statistically significant. Conclusion: In the absence of previous screening mammograms, a small number of BIRADS I mammograms and a significant number of BIRADS II and BIRADS III mammograms undergo a corroborative US examination. The addition of supplemental US to the evaluation of these lesions increase diagnostic confidence and lesion characterization in a population which is not subject to routine screening.",2017 Sep

Imaging findings were reported using the American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS®) criteria. The findings were confirmed histopathologically. Data were analyzed using the Chi-square test.ResultsThe malignancy rate was 35.8% (n = 76). On mammography, lesions size, margins, shape, calcification, and distorted arch/skin thickening were significantly associated with malignancy. On USG, the number of nodules, shape, margins, echotexture, posterior wall echo, through transmission changes, distorted arch/skin thickening, microlobulation, duct extension, and height/width ratio were significantly associated with malignancy. Independently, mammography and USG had a sensitivity of 78.1% and 80.3%, respectively, and a specificity of 83.3% and 89.0%, respectively. Using a positive result of either study as the criteria, the sensitivity was 97.4% and the specificity was 80.1%.ConclusionThe combined use of mammography and USG provides high sensitivity and specificity, thus showing that a combination of two can be used as a screening tool for use in low resource rural settings.",0
453,"Nakashoji A,Matsui A,Nagayama A,Iwata Y,Sasahara M,Murata Y",Clinical predictors of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer.,"The response of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to chemotherapy is heterogeneous; particular subtype classifications based on mRNA gene expression analysis have been demonstrated to be associated with a pathological complete response (pCR). The aim of the present study was to investigate additional clinical and pathological characteristics associated with pCR status. The pathological and clinical characteristics of 40 TNBC patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery were retrospectively analyzed by dividing the cases into two groups according to the response to treatment: pCR (n=12) and non-pCR (n=28). Clinically, patients in the pCR group presented tumors with a significantly less advanced Tumor-Node-Metastasis stage (P=0.030) and mammographic calcification was less common (17 vs. 58%; P=0.034). Pathologically, whereas all cases in the pCR group (12/12, 100%) were of the histological type ‘invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified’ (IDC-NOS), the non-pCR group consisted of a lower proportion of IDC-NOS cases (20/28, 71%) and more cases of special histological types, including mucinous, metaplastic, medullary and apocrine carcinomas (P=0.079). The positive rates of androgen receptor (AR) and forkhead-box A1 (FOXA1) tended to be lower in the pCR group (AR, 0 vs. 29%, P=0.079; FOXA1, 8 vs. 29%, P=0.233). The Ki-67 score was significantly higher in the pCR group than in the non-pCR group (P=0.041). The results suggest that patients with TNBC who present with clinically less advanced tumors and less frequent mammographic calcification are more likely to respond to chemotherapy. From a pathological standpoint, IDC-NOS type, negative AR status and higher Ki-67 scores may be associated with chemotherapy sensitivity.",2017 Oct
454,"Dang D,Prasad H,Rao R",Secretory Pathway Ca2+-ATPases Promote In Vitro Microcalcifications in Breast Cancer Cells.,"Calcification of the breast is often an outward manifestation of underlying molecular changes that drive carcinogenesis. Up to 50% of all non-palpable breast tumors and 90% of ductal carcinoma in situ present with radiographically dense mineralization in mammographic scans. However, surprisingly little is known about the molecular pathways that lead to microcalcifications in the breast. Here, we report on a rapid and quantitative in vitro assay to monitor microcalcifications in breast cancer cell lines, including MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T. We show that the Secretory Pathway Ca2+-ATPases SPCA1 and SPCA2 are strongly induced under osteogenic conditions that elicit microcalcifications. SPCA gene expression is significantly elevated in breast cancer subtypes that are associated with microcalcifications. Ectopic expression of SPCA genes drives microcalcifications and is dependent on pumping activity. Conversely, knockdown of SPCA expression significantly attenuates formation of microcalcifications. We propose that high levels of SPCA pumps may initiate mineralization in the secretory pathway by elevating luminal Ca2+. Our new findings offer mechanistic insight and functional implications on a widely observed, yet poorly understood radiographic signature of breast cancer.",2017 Nov

However, this review aimed to summarize several original and up-to-date articles focusing on the role of this signaling system in cancer cell development and metastasis as well as potential therapeutic agents targeting any of the three tumor necrotic factor super family proteins and/or their downstream signaling pathways. The RANK/RANKL axis has direct effects on tumor cell development. The system is well involved in the development of several primary and secondary tumors including breast cancer, prostate cancer, bone tumors, and leukemia. The signaling of this triad system has also been linked to tumor invasiveness in the advanced stage. Bone is by far the most common site of cancer metastasis. Several therapeutic agents targeting this system have been developed. Among them, a monoclonal antibody, denosumab, was clinically approved for the treatment of osteoporosis and cancer-related diseases.",2017

Methods:: We performed a CT scan in 1 child with a homozygous PCDH12 nonsense variant. We screened DNA samples from 53 patients with primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) and 26 patients with brain calcification of unknown cause (BCUC). Results:: We identified brain calcifications in subcortical and perithalamic regions in the patient with a homozygous PCDH12 nonsense variant. The calcification pattern was different from what has been observed in PFBC and more similar to what is described in in utero infections. In patients with PFBC or BCUC, we found no protein-truncating variant and 3 rare (minor allele frequency <0.001) PCDH12 predicted damaging missense heterozygous variants in 3 unrelated patients, albeit with no segregation data available.

A putative role for PCDH12 variants remains to be determined in PFBC.",2017 Aug
457,"Xue Y,St. Hilaire C,Hortells L,Phillippi JA,Sant V,Sant S",Shape-Specific Nanoceria Mitigate Oxidative Stress-Induced Calcification in Primary Human Valvular Interstitial Cell Culture.,"Introduction: Lack of effective pharmacological treatment makes valvular calcification a significant clinical problem in patients with valvular disease and bioprosthetic/mechanical valve replacement therapies. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in valve tissue have been identified as a prominent hallmark and driving factor for valvular calcification. However, the therapeutic value of ROS-modulating agents for valvular calcification remains elusive. We hypothesized that ROS-modulating shape-specific cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) will inhibit oxidative stress-induced valvular calcification. CNPs are a class of self-regenerative ROS-modulating agents, which can switch between Ce3+ and Ce4+ in response to oxidative microenvironment. In this work, we developed oxidative stress-induced valve calcification model using two patient-derived stenotic valve interstitial cells (hVICs) and investigated the therapeutic effect of shape-specific CNPs to inhibit hVIC calcification. Methods: Human valvular interstitial cells (hVICs) were obtained from a normal healthy donor and two patients with calcified aortic valves. hVICs were characterized for their phenotypic (mesenchymal, myofibroblast and osteoblast) marker expression by qRT-PCR and antioxidant enzymes activity before and after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress. Four shape-specific CNPs (sphere, short rod, long rod, and cube) were synthesized via hydrothermal or ultra-sonication method and characterized for their biocompatibility in hVICs by alamarBlue® assay, and ROS scavenging ability by DCFH-DA assay. H2O2 and inorganic phosphate (Pi) were co-administrated to induce hVIC calcification in vitro as demonstrated by Alizarin Red S staining and calcium quantification. The effect of CNPs on inhibiting H2O2-induced hVIC calcification was evaluated. Results: hVICs isolated from calcified valves exhibited elevated osteoblast marker expression and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities compared to the normal hVICs. Due to the impaired antioxidant enzyme activities, acute H2O2-induced oxidative stress resulted in higher ROS levels and osteoblast marker expression in both diseased hVICs when compared to the normal hVICs. Shape-specific CNPs exhibited shape-dependent abiotic ROS scavenging ability, and excellent cytocompatibility. Rod and sphere CNPs scavenged H2O2-induced oxidative stress in hVICs in a shape- and dose-dependent manner by lowering intracellular ROS levels and osteoblast marker expression. Further, CNPs also enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes in hVICs to combat oxidative stress. Cube CNPs were not effective ROS scavengers. The addition of H2O2 in the Pi-induced calcification model further increased calcium deposition in vitro in a time-dependent manner. Co-administration of rod CNPs with Pi and H2O2 mitigated calcification in the diseased hVICs. Conclusions: We demonstrated that hVICs derived from calcified valves exhibited impaired antioxidant defense mechanisms and were more susceptible to oxidative stress than normal hVICs. CNPs scavenged H2O2-induced oxidative stress in hVICs in a shape-dependent manner. The intrinsic ROS scavenging ability of CNPs and their ability to induce cellular antioxidant enzyme activities may confer protection from oxidative stress-exacerbated calcification. CNPs represent promising antioxidant therapy for treating valvular calcification and deserve further investigation.

458,"Kunimatsu A,Kunimatsu N",Skull Base Tumors and Tumor-Like Lesions: A Pictorial Review.,"A number of tumors and tumor-like non-neoplastic lesions with different cell types on histology occur in the skull base. A wide variety in disease and lesion appearance often complicates the process of radiological diagnosis. The main role of radiographic imaging is the detection and characterization of skull base lesions, with evaluation of the extent of invasion or preservation of adjacent critical organs. Evaluation of the skull base anatomy and surgical planning by using image guidance are also important for surgeons. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are the preferred modalities for the evaluation of skull base lesions. CT and MR are used for lesion detection, tissue characterization and assessment of neurovascular and bone involvement by the lesions. Both modalities provide useful information, one sometimes of greater value than the other. T1-weighted MR imaging is useful in detecting skull base lesions, typically surrounded by abundant fatty bone marrow. T2-weighted MR imaging is generally useful for tumor tissue characterization. CT surpasses MR imaging in evaluating intratumoral calcification and bone destruction or hyperostosis. To date, imaging features have been well-reported in individual skull base tumors; however, correct diagnosis by imaging alone still presents a challenge. Knowledge of clinical issues and awareness of variants of skull base tumors are of help in making a diagnosis. The purpose of this article is to review pertinent clinical issues, typical imaging appearances and certain imaging variations of common skull base lesions.",2017

The aim of this study was to investigate if MIA also inhibits the osteogenic potential of BMP-2 in human articular chondrocytes during redifferentiation, which may lead to a higher grade of differentiation without calcification. HAC of four female patients (mean age: 73.75 ±6.98) were seeded into 3D culture for 28 days; after adding the recombinant proteins, four groups were formed (Control, BMP-2, MIA, BMP-2+MIA). Samples were analysed for gene expression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and histology on day 0, 14 and 28. Collagen type 2 (COL2A1) was significantly increased in the BMP-2 containing groups on day 28; BMP-2 (100-fold, p = 0.001), BMP-2+MIA (65-fold, p = 0.009) and similar to the level of native cartilage. Higher aggrecan (Agg) levels were present in the BMP-2 (3-fold, p = 0.007) and BMP-2+MIA (4-fold, p = 0.002) group after 14 days and in the BMP-2 (9-fold, p = 0.001) group after 28 days. Collagen type 10 (COL10A1) was increased in the BMP-2 containing groups (6-fold, p = 0.006) but these levels were significantly below native cartilage. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen type 1 (COL1A1) and the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content did not reveal any relevant differences between groups. BMP-2 is a potent inducer for differentiation of HAC. A significant enhancement of this effect in combination with MIA could not be observed. Furthermore no significant reduction of osteogenic markers during re-differentiation of chondrocytes was present combining BMP-2 and MIA.",2017

Methods: Ninety-four patients with osteolytic spinal bone metastases from CRC were treated at the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University Hospital Heidelberg between 2000 and 2014. The stability of each affected vertebral body was assessed according to the validated Taneichi bone stability score on the basis of the treatment planning CT scan prior to RT and also based on the follow-up CT examinations at 3 and 6 months after RT. Additionally, bone survival rates (time between first day of RT and death from any cause) as well as prognostic factors for bone survival were evaluated for all study patients. Results: Before RT, 59 patients (63%) were rated unstable according to the Taneichi score. Pathological fractures within the irradiated region were diagnosed in 43 patients (46%) prior to RT. New fractures or progression of previously collapsed vertebrae were diagnosed in 4 patients (4%) after irradiation. Significant re-calcification and stabilization of former unstable bone metastases was only observed in 3/59 patients (3%) and 5/59 patients (9%). The median bone survival was 4.2 months (range 0.5–67.3 months) and 6 months after RT 61% of the patients were dead. Karnofsky performance score (KPS) (< 70% vs. ≥ 70%), chemotherapy and bisphosphonate therapy were predictive prognostic factors for bone survival. Conclusions: Our study population is characterized by poor bone survival and low re-calcification rates of unstable spinal bone lesions 3 and 6 months after RT. To avoid unnecessary hospitalisation and improve remaining QoL, short fractionated treatment schedules of RT may be prefered in this highly palliative situation, particularly for patients with a KPS < 70%.",2017

From January 2014 to March 2017, we retrospectively reviewed 91 patients who were pathologically confirmed as TNBC. According to immunohistochemical cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6) and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), TNBCs were classified into BBCs group and NBCs group. Both CK5/6 and EGFR were negative defined to be NBC, whereas if any of CK5/6 or EGFR was positive then defined as BBC. BBCs group concluded 65 (71.4%) cases and NBCs group concluded26 (28.6%) cases. Ultrasound images and mammograms were reevaluated by breast imaging experts according to the breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) 4th edition. On mammography, masses margins had significant differences between BBCs group and NBCs group (P = 0.024). Most BBCs margins exhibited microlobulated (30/64, 46.9%) or spiculated (25/64, 39.0%), whereas most NBCs margins exhibited microlobulated (17/23, 73.9%). On ultrasound, BBCs were more frequently to present as larger than 20mm lesions (52/65, 80.0%) and more likely to have angular or spiculated margins (35/65, 53.8%), additionally, compared with NBCs, BBCs were less likely to have calcification (1/65, 1.5%). Other mammography and ultrasound features showed no significant differences between the two groups. In conclusion, we have found some effective features of mammography and ultrasound that could be helpful in differentiating BBC and NBC, which will provide some useful references for clinical diagnosis and treatment.",2017 Oct 3

A total of 90 patients who were admitted to Huangshi Central Hospital and diagnosed as breast invasive ductal carcinoma from January 2014 to January 2016 were selected. The expression of PCNA, Ki-67 and COX-2 in cancer tissues and cancer-adjacent normal tissues of patients were detected by immunohistochemical staining, and X-ray features in mammography of patients were observed. By using Spearman correlation analysis, the correlations between expression of PCNA, Ki-67 and COX-2 and X-ray features in mammography in breast cancer were investigated. As a result, the positive expression rates of PCNA, Ki-67 and COX-2 in cancer tissues of the patient groups were respectively 42.2, 45.6 and 51.1%, which were significantly higher than those in cancer-adjacent normal tissues of the control group (p<0.05). PCNA, Ki-67 and COX-2 expression in cancer tissues of the patient group was associated with clinical staging and lymphatic metastasis (p<0.05), but had no correlation with age and tumor size (p>0.05). PCNA, Ki-67 and COX-2 expression in cancer tissues of the patient group had no correlation with the existence of lumps and localized density-increased shadows (p>0.05), but were associated with manifestations of architectural distortion, calcification as well as skin and nipple depression (p<0.05). Spearman correlation analysis revealed that there was a significantly positive correlation between the expression of PCNA and COX-2 in cancer tissues of the patient group (r=0.676, p<0.05); there was a significantly positive correlation between the expression of Ki-67 and COX-2 (r=0.724, p<0.05); PCNA expression had no obvious correlation with the expression of Ki-67 (p>0.05). In conclusion, PCNA, Ki-67 and COX-2 expression is of great significance in the occurrence, invasion and metastasis of breast invasive ductal carcinoma. There is a strong correlation between PCNA, Ki-67 and COX-2 expression levels and X-ray features in mammography in breast invasive ductal carcinoma. The application of X-ray features in mammography can evaluate the expression levels of PCNA, Ki-67 and COX-2 in tissues of breast invasive ductal carcinoma, thereby prospectively predicting biological behavior of these cancer cells and patient prognosis.",2017 Sep

Patients and methods: Literature review of publications concerning autologous fat grafting. Results: Since its introduction, lipofilling has become increasingly popular; however, its results are variable and unpredictable. Several modifications have been made to the procedures of fat harvesting, processing, and injecting. Surgical excision and low negative-pressure aspiration with large-bore cannulas minimize adipocyte damage during fat harvesting. The “wet” method of fat harvesting involves fluid injection at the donor site and facilitates lipoaspiration while minimizing pain and ecchymosis. For fat processing, centrifugation at a low speed is preferable to high-speed centrifugation, gravity separation or filtration. Fat injection at the recipient site should be performed using small-gauge cannulas in a fanning out pattern over multiple sessions, rather than a single session. Fat grafts exhibit not only dermal filler properties but also regenerative potential owing to the presence of stem cells in fat tissue. Thus, the clinical applications of autologous fat grafting include correction of secondary contour defects after breast reconstruction, release of painful scar contractures, and treatment of burn scars and radiodermatitis. Lipofilling is also used in aesthetic surgery, such as facial and hand rejuvenation, augmentation rhinoplasty, and breast and gluteal augmentation. The complications of lipofilling are minimal and include bruising, swelling, pain, infection, necrosis, and calcification. Conclusions: Lipofilling is a low-risk procedure that can be used to correct soft-tissue defects in the face, trunk, and extremities, with minimal discomfort for patients.",2017 Aug

Through the classic pathway with androgens crossing the plasma membrane and binding to the androgen receptor (AR) or via mechanisms independent of the ligand-dependent transactivation function of nuclear receptors, testosterone induces genomic and non-genomic effects respectively. AR is widely distributed in several tissues, including vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Androgens are essential for many developmental and physiological processes, especially in male reproductive tissues. It is now clear that androgens have multiple actions besides sex differentiation and sexual maturation and that many physiological systems are influenced by androgens, including regulation of cardiovascular function [nitric oxide (NO) release, Ca2+ mobilization, vascular apoptosis, hypertrophy, calcification, senescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation].

As demonstrated by various studies in vitro and in vivo, fucoidans show anti-viral, anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant properties, although the detailed molecular action remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study is to assess the impact of crude fucoidan extracts, on the formation of vascular structures in co-culture models relevant for bone vascularization during bone repair and for vascularization processes in osteosarcoma. The co-cultures consisted of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, respectively the osteosarcoma cell line MG63, and human blood derived outgrowth endothelial cells (OEC). The concentration dependent effects on the metabolic activity on endothelial cells and osteoblast cells were first assessed using monocultures of OEC, MSC and MG63 suggesting a concentration of 100 µg/mL as a suitable concentration for further experiments. In co-cultures fucoidan significantly reduced angiogenesis in MSC/OEC but also in MG63/OEC co-cultures suggesting a potential application of fucoidan to lower the vascularization in bone tumors such as osteosarcoma. This was associated with a decrease in VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and SDF-1 (stromal derived factor-1) on the protein level, both related to the control of angiogenesis and furthermore discussed as crucial factors in osteosarcoma progression and metastasis. In terms of bone formation, fucoidan slightly lowered on the calcification process in MSC monocultures and MSC/OEC co-cultures. In summary, these data suggest the suitability of lower fucoidan doses to limit angiogenesis for instance in osteosarcoma.",2017 Jun

Materials and methods: Our institutional review board approved this prospective study, and all patients provided written informed consent. Among 1840 ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsies performed from August 2013 to December 2014, 145 non-mass breast lesions with suspicious microcalcifications on mammography or corresponding magnetic resonance imaging finding were subjected to 13-gauge VAB or 14-gauge CCNB. We evaluated the technical success rates, average specimen numbers, and tissue sampling time. We also compared the results of percutaneous biopsy and final surgical pathologic diagnosis to analyze the rates of diagnostic upgrade or downgrade. Results: Ultrasound-guided VAB successfully targeted and sampled all lesions, whereas CCNB failed to demonstrate calcification in four (10.3%) breast lesions with microcalcification on specimen mammography. The mean sampling time were 238.6 and 170.6 seconds for VAB and CCNB, respectively. No major complications were observed with either method. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) lesions were more frequently upgraded after CCNB (8/23 and 3/5, respectively) than after VAB (2/26 and 0/4, respectively P = 0.028).

470,"Chang AR,Anderson C",Dietary Phosphorus Intake and the Kidney.,"Although phosphorus is an essential nutrient required for multiple physiological functions, recent research raises concerns that high phosphorus intake could have detrimental effects on health. Phosphorus is abundant in the food supply of developed countries, occurring naturally in protein-rich foods and as an additive in processed foods. High phosphorus intake can cause vascular and renal calcification, renal tubular injury, and premature death in multiple animal models. Small studies in human suggest that high phosphorus intake may result in positive phosphorus balance and correlate with renal calcification and albuminuria. Although serum phosphorus is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease, progression of kidney disease, and death, limited data exist linking high phosphorus intake directly to adverse clinical outcomes. Further prospective studies are needed to determine whether phosphorus intake is a modifiable risk factor for kidney disease.",2017 Aug 21

The present study aimed to analyze published data on mucinous cholangiocarcinoma. Medical databases were searched from 1980 to 2016, and clinicopathological data for 16 mucinous cholangiocarcinoma patients were obtained. Characteristic imaging findings, including hypovascular tumor with peripheral enhancement on computed tomography and angiography, extremely high intensity on T2‐weighted magnetic resonance images, intratumoral calcification and luminal communication between the tumor and bile duct on cholangiography, were noted. Mucinous cholangiocarcinoma was correctly diagnosed in one patient only, with some patients diagnosed as low‐malignant biliary cystic tumors preoperatively. Five cases were followed up after the first medical examination, and three of these were initially diagnosed as biliary cystadenoma or intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct. All five tumors showed marked enlargement within 4 months of follow up. Macroscopically, the resected tumors were non‐cystic/solid in seven cases, and cystic in seven. Tumor diameter ranged from 5 cm to 22 cm, and mucoid cut surface, lobulation, lack of capsule and papillary growth were observed. Microscopically, co‐existing intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct was noted in three of five patients with available data. Nine of 10 cases in whom the pathological stage was reported had advanced disease with lymph node and/or distant metastasis, and 5‐year survival was achieved in one microinvasive case only. Overall 1‐ and 3‐year survival rates were 60.1% and 40.1%, respectively. The possibility of mucinous cholangiocarcinoma should be considered when biliary cystic tumors are detected on imaging modalities, despite the rarity of this tumor.",2017 Jun
472,"Lau I,Potluri A,Ibeh CL,Redman RS,Paal E,Bandyopadhyay BC",Microcalcifications in stone-obstructed human submandibular gland are associated with apoptosis and cell proliferation.,"Objective: Human submandibular gland (SMG) stones are associated with inflammation, fibrosis and microcalcifications in the surrounding tissues. However, there is little information about the accompanying cell injury-repair process, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. The purpose of this study was to investigate such an association and its clinical significance. Design of Study: Mid-gland paraffin sections of human SMGs (“stone glands”) and normal SMGs (“non-stone glands”) were subjected to stains for general histology (hematoxylin and eosin), fibrosis (Masson’s trichrome), and calcification (alizarin red) and to immunohistochemistry for proliferative activity (Ki-67), and apoptosis (Caspase-3). Tissues were assessed for areas of inflammation, calcium deposition, and fibrosis, and for cycling and apoptotic cells. Results: Acini were atrophic and proportionately fewer in lobules with fibrosis in stone glands. Additionally, stone glands had intraluminal calcifications (microliths) in scattered excretory and striated ducts and blood vessel walls. Areas of inflammation and fibrosis were small and uncommon, and calcifications were not seen in non-stone glands. Proliferating and apoptotic cells were common in the main duct of stone glands where ciliated and mucous cell hyperplasia and stratified squamous metaplasia had occurred, uncommon in the main duct of non-stone glands, and uncommon in all other parenchymal elements of both stone and non-stone glands. Conclusion: Stone obstruction in the main excretory ducts of SMG resulted in progressive depletion of acini from proximal to distal lobules via calcification, inflammation, fibrosis, and parenchymal cell atrophy, apoptosis and proliferation. Interlobular duct microliths contributed to this depletion by further provoking intralobular inflammation, fibrosis, and acinar atrophy.",2017 Oct

474,"Farrokh D,Boloursaz S,Homai F",Relationship among mammographic findings with histopathologic type of breast cancer and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in young women.,"Introduction: Radiological measures to diagnose breast cancer, including mammographic and ultrasound assessments in young women, are associated with restrictions affecting the use of this tool. No adequate information is available on mammography view in young people with breast cancer and its relationship with pathologic type and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as a prognostic marker, especially in the Iranian race. This study was conducted to examine the relationship between mammographic findings of young women with breast cancer with diagnosed histopathologic type and HER2 marker status. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out on women with breast cancer referred to Omid Hospital in Mashhad, Iran. Inclusion criteria were age less than 45 years and definitive diagnosis of breast cancer documented in the patient record. Information on mammographic findings such as mass, asymmetry, microcalcification, tissue distortion, nipple retraction, and skin thickening was collected from patient medical records. In addition, the type of pathology diagnosed based on biopsy samples and HER2 examination results were collected. The chi-square test and SPSS software were used to analyze the relationship among qualitative variables. Results: This study was performed on 153 patients with a mean age of 39.3±2.5 years (minimum 20 years and maximum 45 years). The mammographic finding was reported normal in 41 patients (26.7%). The evidence of malignant mass was observed in 48 patients (31.3%). The microcalcification was found in 31 patients (20.3%). The retraction or thickening of breast tissue was seen in 39 patients (25.5%). The distortion of breast stroma was found in 41 patients (26.8%). The HER2 marker in 76 patients (49.7%) was positive in study subjects. There was no statistically significant association between mammographic findings and pathologic type. Among the mammographic findings, only the presence of microcalcification had significant association with HER2 results (p=0.008). Conclusion: It seems that a significant relationship could not be found between mammographic features in patients with breast cancer and type of pathology diagnosed. However, the presence of calcification in mammography is associated with positive HER2.",2017 May
475,"Qi X,Chen A,Zhang P,Zhang W,Cao X,Xiao C",Mammographic calcification can predict outcome in women with breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery.,"The impact of calcification in patients with breast carcinoma treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is unclear. The present study aimed to determine the outcome of breast cancer patients with calcification treated with BCS. The records of 409 patients with breast carcinoma treated with BCS from January 2005 to December 2008 were reviewed. Patients were categorized as those with calcification (on mammography or ultrasonography), or those without calcification (neither on mammography nor ultrasonography). The local relapse free survival time (LRFS), disease free survival time (DFS) and overall survival time (OS) were compared, and subgroup analysis was performed based on morphological types and distribution patterns of mammographic calcification. Survival analysis demonstrated that patients with calcification had a significantly increased risk of local recurrence, distant metastasis and mortality compared with those without calcification [relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI): local recurrence, 2.46 and 1.11–5.44; distant metastasis, 2.24 and 1.19–4.24; mortality, 2.50 and 1.06–5.86]. Subgroup analysis revealed that the distribution patterns (rather than morphological types of calcification) accounted for the increased risk of recurrence following BCS. Patients with mammographic calcification of liner/segmental distribution had significantly decreased LRFS (RR=6.20; 95% CI, 2.26–16.98), DFS (RR=6.81; 95% CI, 2.86–16.20) and OS (RR=9.14; 95% CI, 2.53–33.00), while patients with mammographic calcification of clustered distribution did not have significantly decreased LRFS, DFS and OS (P>0.05), compared with those without calcification. In addition, the mammographic calcification spreading along the ducts was more likely to be accompanied by an extensive intraductal component (P<0.001). Finally, the outcome of patients with calcification on breast ultrasound was as good as those without calcification. Patients with mammographic calcification, particularly those with calcification spreading along the ducts, have a higher risk of recurrence following BCS, which has a negative impact on long-term survival. Calcification identified on breast ultrasonography does not affect the survival of patients treated with BCS.",2017 Jul

This is due to the tendency of the tumor to invade the surrounding brain tissue and the generation of a local inflammatory state between the tumor cells and parenchyma. While there is evidence to suggest that interleukin-6 (IL-6) induces craniopharyngioma (CP)-associated inflammation, particularly in ACP, the role of IL-6 in the progression of ACP remains unclear. The results of the present study demonstrated that CP inflammation was associated with pathological classification, extent of surgery, degree of calcification and postoperative hypothalamic status scale. Cytokine antibody arrays were conducted to measure the expression of IL-6 and other inflammatory factors in tumor tissues in response to various levels of inflammatory exposure. IL-6, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and glycoprotein 130 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. In addition, an ELISA was performed to quantify the levels of soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) in the cystic fluid and supernatants of ACP cells and tumor-associated fibroblasts. These measurements demonstrated that ACP cells produce IL-6 and its associated proteins. In addition, the results revealed that while the viability of ACP cells was not affected, the migration of ACP cells was promoted by IL-6 treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Conversely, treatment with an IL-6-blocking monoclonal antibody significantly decreased the migration of ACP cells. In addition, IL-6 treatment increased the expression of vimentin and decreased the expression of E-cadherin in a dose-dependent manner. The findings of the present study demonstrate that IL-6 may promote migration in vitro via the classic- and trans-signaling pathways by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ACP cell cultures.",2017 Jun

Recently published studies have also suggested a modest correlation of BAC with coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring. Roughly 40 million mammograms are already performed annually in the United States with overlap in patients that undergo CAD screening via CAC scoring. Thus, identification of cardiovascular risk by demonstrating an association between BAC and CAC may enable an instrumental sex‐specific methodology to identify asymptomatic women at risk for CAD. The purpose of this article is to review the current state of the literature for BAC and its association with CAC, to review contemporary breast cancer screening guidelines, and to discuss the clinical implications of these findings.",2017 Sep

We investigated whether evaluation of the grayscale inverted images of mammograms would aid in increasing the diagnostic sensitivity of the mammographic imaging technique. Methods: Our study included 636 mammograms of 159 women who had undergone digital mammography. Standard, grayscale inverted, and standard plus grayscale inverted images were sequentially examined three times, at 15-day intervals, for the presence or assessment of pathological changes in the skin, calcification, asymmetric density, mass lesions, structural distortions, and intramammary and axillary lymph nodes. To determine whether grayscale inverted image assessment improved detection rates, the results of the three assessment modes were compared using Cochran’s Q test and the McNemar test (p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant). Results: The average age of 159 patients was 50.4 years (range, 35–80 years). There were significant differences among the three assessment modes with respect to calcification and intramammary lymph nodes (p < 0.05); however, no significant differences were observed for the detection of other parameters. Conclusions: Assessment of grayscale inverted images in addition to standard images facilitates the detection of microcalcification.",2017

481,"Kim D,Franco G,Shigehara H,Asaumi J,Hildenbrand P",Benign Miliary Osteoma Cutis of the Face: A Common Incidental CT Finding.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:: Osteoma cutis of the face represents a primary or secondary formation of ossific foci in the facial skin. Its primary form has been sparsely described in the plastic surgery and dermatology literature. As radiologists, we routinely encounter incidental, very small facial calcified nodules on CT studies performed for a variety of unrelated reasons. We hypothesized that this routinely encountered facial calcification represents primary miliary osteoma cutis and is a common, benign, age-related finding. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: We retrospectively reviewed 1315 consecutive sinus CTs obtained during an 8-month period and their associated demographics. The number of dermal radiopaque lesions with Hounsfield units of >150 was counted, and we analyzed the association between the prevalence of these lesions and patients' demographics with logistic regression methods. RESULTS:: Five hundred ninety-nine males and 716 females from 4 to 90 years of age were included in the study (mean, 52 versus 51 years; P = .259). Among these, 252 males and 301 females had small facial calcified nodules (42.1% versus 42.0%, P = .971). The patient's age was a statistically significant predictor for having facial calcified nodules (odds ratio = 1.02, P < .001), while the patient's sex was not (P = .826). CONCLUSIONS:: Facial calcified nodules, observed in routine head and face CT imaging, are common, benign, age-related findings, which have been largely overlooked in the radiology literature. It is a manifestation of primary miliary osteoma cutis.",2017 Apr

Routine mammography is performed on all menopausal women as a screening tool. Determination of the relation between breast arterial calcification (BAC) on mammography and the bone density of this high-risk population could help us to determine those with osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the mentioned probable relation between BAC and osteoporosis. Materials and Methods:: In this cross-sectional study, menopausal women referred for annual screening mammography were enrolled. According to the results of mammography, they were classified into two groups: menopausal women with and without calcification of breast arteries. The selected women were referred for bone mineral density (BMD) evaluation by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The results of BMD were compared between the two studied groups. Results:: In this study, BMD was measured in 43 and 45 menopausal women with and without BAC, respectively. After age adjustment the difference between BMD measurements were not statistically significantly different (P > 0.05). There was a significant negative correlation between age and lumbar (P = 0.002, r = -0.42) and hip bone (P = 0.000, r = -0.67) density in menopausal women with BAC. Conclusion:: The results of the current study indicated that there was no significant relationship between BAC and BMD in our studied population, but it seems that increasing age has an important role in both developing BAC and reducing BMD. For obtaining more conclusive results, further studies with larger sample sizes and considering the severity of BAC is recommended.",2017

The aim of this study is to define the clinical and histopathologic spectrum of intraoral SDCs. Cases were retrieved from the archives of Harvard School of Dental Medicine/StrataDx, Inc. from January 2012 to August 2014. There were 177 cases of which 103 (58.2%) occurred in females, with a median age of 56 (range 2–95). Approximately half of cases (45.8%) presented in the area of the buccal mucosa, lower lip mucosa, or mandibular vestibule, and 23.2% presented in the floor of mouth. SDCs were lined at least focally by 1–2 layers of cuboidal/columnar epithelium in 85.3% of cases and showed varying degrees of metaplasia (oncocytic, mucous cell, squamous, ciliated, apocrine-like) in 68.4% of cases. Intraluminal mucous stasis was present in 41.8% of SDCs, incipient calcification was present within 4.5% of SDCs, and chronic obstructive sialadenitis was seen in 90.2% of cases. No cysts showed adenomatous ductal proliferations or true papillary structures with fibrovascular cores, although 41.2% exhibited reactive undulation of cyst lining. Thirty-nine ‘papillary oncocytic cystadenoma-like’ SDCs (22.0%) demonstrated complete oncocytic metaplasia and marked undulation. An additional seven such cysts (4.0%) had a ‘Warthin tumor-like’ lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Intraoral SDCs occur most commonly in the sixth decade of life in locations distinct from extravasation mucoceles, likely secondary to intraluminal obstruction.

We also wanted to investigate whether other clinicopathologic indexes influence the strain ratio (SR) of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). We retrospectively reviewed 126 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) from 103 patients who underwent ultrasonography and elastography before surgery. The histologic characteristics and clinicopathologic indexes were compared with the SR of ultrasound elastography (UE). The results showed that there was a significantly positive correlation between fibrosis degree and SR measurements (r = 0.754, p = 0.000); the SR was significantly different between the groups with and without calcification (11.34 ± 10.08 vs. 6.81 ± 7.33, p = 0.000). The standard coefficients of collagen and stromal calcification were 0.684 and 0.194, respectively. There was no significant correlation between SR and indices such as size, position, co-existence with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT), multifocality or cervical lymph node (CLN) metastasis. In conclusion, we found that the SR of UE is positively correlated with the fibrosis of PTC. Stromal calcification will elevate the SR dramatically, but psammoma bodies will not when they exist in the absence of stromal calcification.",2017

Previous reports indicated that epigenomic regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) might play important roles in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification. Here, we identified potential key miRNAs involved in vascular calcification in vivo and investigated the role of miR-32-5p (miR-32). According to microarray analysis, we observed increased expression of miR-125b, miR-30a, and miR-32 and decreased expression of miR-29a, miR-210, and miR-320 during the progression of vascularcalcification. Additionally, gain- and loss-of-function studies of miR-32 confirmed promotion of VSMC calcification in mice through the enhanced expression of bonemorphogenetic protein-2, runt-related transcription factor-2(RUNX2), osteopontin, and the bone-specific phosphoprotein matrix GLA protein in vitro. Moreover, miR-32 modulated vascularcalcification progression by activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)signaling and increasing RUNX2 expression and phosphorylation by targeting the 3′-untranslated region of phosphatase and tensin homolog Mrna (PTEN) in mouse VSMCs. Furthermore, we detected higher miR-32 levels in plasmafrom patients with coronary artery disease with coronary artery calcification (CAC) as compared with levels observed in non-CAC patients (P = 0.016), further confirming miR-32 as a critical modulator and potential diagnostic marker for CAC.",2017

Results: For microcalcification-associated breast cancers, seven selected features (age, tumor size, Ki-67 status, lymphovascular invasion, calcification range, calcification diameter and calcification density) were significantly associated with LN status (all P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that three risk factors (age: older vs. younger OR: 0.973 P = 0.006, tumor size: larger vs. smaller OR: 1.671, P < 0.001 and calcification density: calcifications > 20/cm2 vs. calcifications ≤ 20/cm2 OR: 1.698, P < 0.001) were significant independent predictors. This model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.701. The nodal staging (N0 and N1 χ2 = 5.701, P = 0.017; N0 and N2 χ2 = 6.614, P = 0.013) was significantly positively associated with calcification density. The luminal B subtype had the highest risk of LN metastasis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that calcification > 2 cm in range (OR: 2.209) and larger tumor size (OR: 1.882) were independently predictive of LN metastasis in the luminal B subtype (AUC = 0.667). Materials and Methods: Mammographic images of 419 female breast cancer patients were included. Associations between the risk factors and LN status were evaluated using a Chi-square test, ANOVA and binary logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: This study found that age, tumor size and calcifications density can be conveniently used to facilitate the preoperative prediction of LN metastasis.

QSM technology may be regarded to be sufficiently developed and validated to warrant wide dissemination for clinical applications of imaging isotropic susceptibility, which is dominated by metals in tissue, including iron and calcium. These biometals are highly regulated as vital participants in normal cellular biochemistry, and their dysregulations are manifested in a variety of pathologic processes. Therefore, QSM can be used to assess important tissue functions and disease. To facilitate QSM clinical translation, this review aims to organize pertinent information for implementing a robust automated QSM technique in routine MRI practice and to summarize available knowledge on diseases for which QSM can be used to improve patient care. In brief, QSM can be generated with postprocessing whenever gradient echo MRI is performed. QSM can be useful for diseases that involve neurodegeneration, inflammation, hemorrhage, abnormal oxygen consumption, substantial alterations in highly paramagnetic cellular iron, bone mineralization, or pathologic calcification; and for all disorders in which MRI diagnosis or surveillance requires contrast agent injection.

Computed tomography of the chest revealed a spherical mass with calcification and fatty foci located in the anterior mediastinum, thus a presumptive diagnosis of teratoma was made. Diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes:: Video-assisted thoracoscopic explorations and resection of mediastinal tumor were then performed. The pathological examination showed that the tumor was EHE. Postoperative radiotherapy was delivered to the patient. Pulmonary metastases were found by chest CT a year after surgery. Lessons:: A diagnosis of EHE might be considered, when a mediastinal tumor closely related to veins showing intratumoral calcification and obvious enhancement, despite the presence of a clear boundary and visible fat content.",2017 Mar

As a consequence of treatment, the extent of radiation-induced toxicity is a crucial feature with consequences to a patient’s quality of life. In this context this study aims at reducing the extent of radiation-induced side effects and toxicity by assuming a better sparing of normal tissue with the use of intensity-modulated instead of conventionally delivered external beam radiotherapy. Methods/design: In this prospective, randomized, single-center trial for patients with spinal bone metastases, RT is performed as either image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (10x3Gy) or conventionally fractionated external beam radiotherapy (10x3Gy). Afterwards radiation-induced toxicity will be assessed and compared 3 and 6 months after the end of radiation. Discussion: The aim of this pilot study is the evaluation of achievable benefits, with reduced radiation toxicity being the primary endpoint in the comparison of intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus conventional radiotherapy for patients with spinal bone metastases. Secondarily, bone re-calcification, quality of life, pain relief, spinal instability, and local control will be measured and compared between the two treatment groups.

Methods: Non-thyroid neck masses requiring surgical interventions were evaluated using conventional B-mode ultrasonography (US) (size, short/long axis rate, shape, hilum, echogenity, calcification, necrosis, and peripheral edema) and sonoelastograpy (SE) with strain ratio (SR) and elasticity score (ES) before surgery. These parameters were compared with the histopathological examination. Results: In total, 116 non-thyroid neck masses (66 lymph node, 35 parotid gland, eight submandibular gland, and seven cervical mass) of 89 patients (51 men, 38 women) with a mean age of 50.3±15.1 (19–79) years were evaluated. Thirty-seven malignant lymph nodes (23 metastatic and 14 lymphoma), seven malignant parotid tumors, two malignant submandibular tumors, 29 benign lymph nodes, 28 benign parotid lesions, and six benign submandibular lesions were evaluated. Mean SR and ES values of malignant masses were 6.3/3.2 for lymph nodes, 5.5/3.3 for the parotid gland, and 4.2/3 for the submandibular gland. Mean SR and ES values of benign lesions were 2.0/2.1 for lymph nodes, 4.4/3.2 for the parotid gland, and 3.2/3 for the submandibular gland. SR and ES were significantly higher for malignant masses compared with those for benign ones. SR was more predictive than ES in evaluating malignant lymph nodes. The area under the curve was 0.917(0.827–1.00) (p<0.05) for SR in differentiating benign-malignant lymph nodes, and the upper cut-off value was two. SR and ES were higher in the malign parotid and submandibular gland lesions than the benign ones, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Strain ratio value could be a useful parameter in differentiating benign-malignant lymph nodes. More studies are necessary for differentiating benign-malignant parotid and submandibular lesions using SE.",2017 Mar

A cross-sectional study.,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate breast arterial calcification (BAC) detected on routine mammography, analyzing its association with chronic degenerative disease. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving women treated at a specialized outpatient clinic for high-risk hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease, as well as volunteers who participated in a study to validate a method of screening for occult renal disease. A total of 312 patients between 40 and 69 years of age, with no history of breast cancer, all of whom had undergone routine mammography in the last two years, were included. The mammograms were analyzed by researchers who were unaware of the risk factors for BAC in each case. Results: The mean age was 55.9 ± 7.4 years, and 64.3% of the patients were white. The mean glomerular filtration rate was 41.87 ± 6.23 mL/min/1.73 m2. Seventy-one patients (22.8%) had BAC. We found that BAC was associated with advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and low glomerular filtration rate. In the multivariate analysis, advanced age and diabetes continued to be associated with BAC. The odds ratio for BAC was higher for all chronic diseases. Conclusion: The association of BAC with advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and low glomerular filtration rate should call the attention of radiologists. Therefore, the presence of BAC should be reported, and patients with BAC should be screened for those diseases.",2017 Mar-Apr 2017 Mar-Apr

Genetic risk factors of calciphylaxis have never been studied before. Methods: We investigated 10 target genes using a tagging SNP approach: the genes encoding CD73/ ecto-5'-nucleotidase (purinergic pathway), Matrix Gla protein, Fetuin A, Bone Gla protein, VKORC1 (all related to intrinsic calcification inhibition), calcium-sensing receptor, FGF23, Klotho, vitamin D receptor, stanniocalcin 1 (all related to CKD-MBD). 144 dialysis patients from the German calciphylaxis registry were compared with 370 dialysis patients without history of CUA. Genotyping was performed using iPLEX Gold MassARRAY(Sequenom, San Diego, USA), KASP genotyping chemistry (LGC, Teddington, Middlesex, UK) or sequencing. Statistical analysis comprised logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and sex. Results: 165 SNPs were finally analyzed and 6 SNPs were associated with higher probability for calciphylaxis (OR>1) in our cohort. Nine SNPs of three genes (CD73, FGF23 and Vitamin D receptor) reached nominal significance (p< 0.05), but did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple testing. Of the CD73 gene, rs4431401 (OR = 1.71, 95%CI 1.08–2.17, p = 0.023) and rs9444348 (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.11–1.97, p = 0.008) were associated with a higher probability for CUA. Of the FGF23 and VDR genes, rs7310492, rs11063118, rs13312747 and rs17882106 were associated with a higher probability for CUA. Conclusion: Polymorphisms in the genes encoding CD73, vitamin D receptor and FGF23 may play a role in calciphylaxis development. Although our study is the largest genetic study on calciphylaxis, it is limited by the low sample sizes. It therefore requires replication in other cohorts if available.",2017
496,"Hou YC,Liu WC,Zheng CM,Zheng JQ,Yen TH,Lu KC",Role of Vitamin D in Uremic Vascular Calcification.,"The risk of cardiovascular death is 10 times higher in patients with CKD (chronic kidney disease) than in those without CKD. Vascular calcification, common in patients with CKD, is a predictor of cardiovascular mortality. Vitamin D deficiency, another complication of CKD, is associated with vascular calcification in patients with CKD. GFR decline, proteinuria, tubulointerstitial injury, and the therapeutic dose of active form vitamin D aggravate vitamin D deficiency and reduce its pleiotropic effect on the cardiovascular system. Vitamin D supplement for CKD patients provides a protective role in vascular calcification on the endothelium by (1) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inactivation, (2) alleviating insulin resistance, (3) reduction of cholesterol and inhibition of foam cell and cholesterol efflux in macrophages, and (4) modulating vascular regeneration. For the arterial calcification, vitamin D supplement provides adjunctive role in regressing proteinuria, reverse renal osteodystrophy, and restoring calcification inhibitors. Recently, adventitial progenitor cell has been linked to be involved in the vascular calcification. Vitamin D may provide a role in modulating adventitial progenitor cells. In summary, vitamin D supplement may provide an ancillary role for ameliorating uremic vascular calcification.",2017

The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a significant systemic predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The coronary artery calcium score (CACS) reflects coronary artery calcification and is an independent risk factor for coronary artery stenosis. In the present study, we explored the relationship between the NLR and CACS in terms of subclinical inflammation and coronary artery calcification. Materials and Methods. We evaluated males and females who did not have CVD, diabetes, high blood pressure, or high fasting blood sugar levels. We measured white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte counts, fasting blood sugar, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels in blood samples. We also obtained CACSs using coronary multidetector computed tomography. Results. Multivariate logistic regression showed that older age was significantly associated with a higher CACS (P < 0.001); males had higher CACSs than females (P < 0.001); and the higher the TG level, the higher the CACS (P = 0.019). The NLR of males, but not females, was significantly associated with the CACS. Conclusion. An independent association between the NLR and CACS was thus evident in healthy adult males after adjusting for other CVD risk factors. Therefore, the NLR is a significant predictor of potential CVD in male subjects with subclinical atherosclerosis.",2017

The study included 238 benign TNs and 150 malignant TNs. Conventional ultrasound (US) features and VTIQ parameters were obtained and compared with the reference standard of histopathological and/or cytological results. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to select independent variables leading to misdiagnosis. The maximum shear wave speed (SWS) (SWS-max), mean SWS (SWS-mean), SWS-ratio and standard deviation of SWS (SWS-SD) were significantly higher for malignant TNs compared with benign TNs (all P < 0.001). SWS-mean achieved the highest diagnostic performance with a cut-off value of 3.15 m/s. False positive rate was 13.4% (32/238) while false negative rate was 35.3% (53/150). Intranodular calcification (OR: 1.715) was significantly associated with false positive VTIQ findings, while nodule size (OR: 0.936) and echotexture of the thyroid gland (OR: 0.033) were negatively associated with them. Nodule depth (OR: 0.881) and TI-RADS category (OR: 0.563) were negatively associated with false negative VTIQ findings.

Contrary to traditional belief, CAVD is not a passive, degenerative disease but rather a dynamic disease, where initial cellular changes in the valve leaflets progress into fibrotic lesions that induce valve thickening and calcification. Advanced thickening and calcification impair valve function and lead to aortic stenosis (AS). Without intervention, progressive ventricular hypertrophy ensues, which ultimately results in heart failure and death. Currently, aortic valve replacement (AVR), surgical or transcatheter, is the only effective therapy to treat CAVD. However, these costly interventions are often delayed until the late stages of the disease. Nonetheless, 275000 are performed per year worldwide, and this is expected to triple by 2050. Given the current landscape, next-generation therapies for CAVD are needed to improve patient outcome and quality of life. Here, we first provide a background on the aortic valve (AV) and the pathobiology of CAVD as well as highlight current directions and future outlook on the development of functional 3D models of CAVD in vitro. We then consider an often-overlooked aspect contributing to CAVD: miRNA (mis)regulation. Therapeutics could potentially normalize miRNA levels in the early stages of the disease and may slow its progression or even reverse calcification. We close with a discussion of strategies that would enable the use of miRNA as a therapeutic for CAVD. This focuses on an overview of controlled delivery technologies for nucleic acid therapeutics to the valve or other target tissues.",2017 Feb 01

We aimed to assess the associations of arterial calcification in the breast, splenic, and internal and external iliac arteries with CVD risk factors and mortality. Methods: We conducted a case-cohort study nested in a cohort of 5196 individuals who self-referred or were referred by a health care provider for whole body computed tomography (CT), including a random subcohort (n=395) and total and CVD mortality cases (n=298 and n=90), who died during a median follow-up of 9.4 years. Arterial calcification in the breast, splenic, and internal and external iliac arteries on CT was scored using a simple visual score. AC and CAC were previously measured using the Agatston technique. Logistic regression models were made to study associations of CVD risk factors with calcification in the different vascular beds. Prentice-weighted Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for CVD risk factors, and calcification in other vascular beds, were used to study associations with mortality. Results: In the subcohort, the mean age was 56.6 years (SD 11.1) and 41.3% were female. The prevalence of calcification on CT, was 11.6% in the splenic, 47.9% in the internal iliac and 9.5% in the external iliac arteries, while 3.7% of women had breast artery calcification (BAC). Calcification in the splenic and iliac arteries was associated with calcification in the abdominal aorta but differentially associated with other CVD risk factors in logistic regression models. The prevalence of BAC was too low to fit these multivariable models. Calcification of the external iliac arteries was significantly associated with both all-cause and CVD mortality, but no longer significant when adjusted for CVD risk factors. Breast artery calcification was associated with both all-cause and CVD mortality independent of CVD risk factors and AAC and CAC (all-cause HR 5.67 [95% CI 1.50–21.41]). Conclusions: Risk factors associated with calcification, and the association of calcification with risk of mortality differ across vascular beds, possibly reflecting different pathophysiology.",2017 Apr

Based on the comparison of the calcification number, diameter, and the diameter of tumor among head side, foot side, inner side, outer side and rear side, the difference was meaningless in terms of statistics. Based on the comparison between SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio and between dose efficiency η and quality factor M in different areas, the difference was not statistically significant.

Materials and Methods:: A total of 136 patients were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Forty-eight patients had GD and the remaining 88 patients did not. The presence or absence of gallstones was noted during abdominal ultrasonography while vascular risk factors such as plaque formation, intima-media thickness, plaque calcification, mural thrombus, stenosis, aneurysm, and inflammation were recorded during an abdominopelvic computed tomography scan. In addition, percentage of the abdominopelvic aorta surface covered by atheromatous plaque was calculated. Results:: The mean age of patients with GD and without GD was 50.81 ± 16.20 and 50.40 ± 12.43, respectively. Patients with GD were more likely to have diabetes mellitus, a higher body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.001), and higher cholesterol (P < 0.01), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P < 0.02) levels. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding other atherosclerotic risk factors. Patients with GD had significantly higher rates of the vascular risk factors as intima-media thickness, plaque formation, calcification, aneurysm, mural thrombosis, stenosis, and inflammation in all abdominal arterial segments other than aneurysm in the femoral arteries. In addition, patients with GD had severe atheromatous plaques in the abdominal aorta, common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral artery (CFA). In patients with GD, parameters of age, BMI, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were all correlated with the severity of the atheromatous plaque in abdominal aorta, common iliac, external iliac, and CFA.

Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of ultrasonography (US) features for lymph node metastasis in PTMC. Methods: Seven hundred twelve patients with PTMC who underwent conventional ultrasonography examinations of the cervical lymph nodes were included. All included cases underwent total thyroidectomy plus prophylactic central lymph node dissection. The included lymph nodes were marked superficially, and the corresponding lymph nodes were completely removed and sent for pathological examination. The US features of lymph nodes with and without metastasis were compared, and the odds ratios of the suspicious US features were determined with univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Round shape, loss of an echogenic fatty hilum, cystic change, calcification, and abnormal vascularity were significantly more common in metastatic than nonmetastatic lymph nodes, whereas the boundary and echo did not significantly differ. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that round shape, loss of echogenic fatty hilum, cystic change, calcification, and abnormal vascularity were independent predictive factors for the assessment of metastatic lymph nodes. Round shape had the highest sensitivity of all variables, while loss of an echogenic fatty hilum had the highest specificity and accuracy. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which was calculated to verify the relationship between the various US features and metastatic lymph nodes, was 0.793.

Therefore soluble Klotho could serve as an early and sensitive marker of kidney function decline. Moreover, preclinical animal data support Klotho deficiency is not just merely a biomarker, but a pathogenic factor for CKD progression and extrarenal CKD complications including cardiovascular disease and disturbed mineral metabolism. Prevention of Klotho decline, re-activation of endogenous Klotho production or supplementation of exogenous Klotho are all associated with attenuation of renal fibrosis, retardation of CKD progression, improvement of mineral metabolism, amelioration of cardiomyopathy, and alleviation of vascular calcification in CKD.

Results: Identified were 93 (19.1%) Luminal A, 242 (49.9%) Luminal B, 108 (22.2%) HER2 and 42 (8.7%) basal subtypes. In univariate analysis, the clinicopathological parameters and BI-RADS 3–5 microcalcifications, which consisted 9 selected features was significantly associated with breast cancer molecular subtype (all P < 0.05). Among subtypes, multivariate analysis showed that calcification >2 cm in range (OR: 1.878, 95% CI: 1.150 to 3.067) and calcification > 0.5 mm in diameter (OR:2.206, 95% CI: 1.235 to 3.323) was independently predictive of HER2 subtype. The model showed good discrimination for predicting HER2 subtype, with a C-index of 0.704. In addition, multivariate analysis showed that calcification morphology (amorphour or coarse heterogenous calcifications OR: 2.847, 95% CI: 1.526 to 5.312) was independently predictive of Luminal A subtype. The model showed good discrimination for predicting Luminal A subtype, with a C-index of 0.74. And we demonstrated that amorphour or coarse heterogenous calcifications were associated with a higher incidence of Luminal A subtype than pleomorphic or fine linear or branching calcifications. There was no significant difference between breast cancer subtypes (Luminal B vs. other; Basal vs. other) and the patterns of mammographically detected calcifications. Materials and Methods: Mammographic images of 485 female patients were included. The correlation between mammographic imaging features and breast cancer subtype was analyzed using Chi-square test, univariate and binary logistic regression analysis.

All the nodules received conventional ultrasound (US) and SWS imaging (Aplio500, Toshiba Medical Systems, Japan) before fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and/or surgery. The values of E-max and E-mean with elastic modulus (61.27 ± 36.31 kPa and 31.89 ± 19.11 kPa) or SWS (4.45 ± 1.49 m/s and 3.26 ± 2.71 m/s) in malignant nodules were significantly higher than those in benign lesions (29.18 ± 18.62 kPa and 15.85 ± 6.96 kPa, or 2.98 ± 0.85 m/s and 2.19 ± 0.42 m/s, all P < 0.001). No significant differences in area under the curve (AUC) between the SWS imaging parameters were found (all P > 0.05). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, E-max (m/s) with SWS was identified to be the strongest independent predictor for malignant nodules (odds ratio [OR] = 16.760), followed by poorly-defined margin (OR = 7.792), taller-than-wide shape (OR = 3.160), micro-calcification (OR = 2.422), and E-max (kPa) with elastic modulus (OR = 0.914).

It is proposed to have stronger atheroprotective properties than dietary isoflavones. We examined a cross-sectional association of dietary isoflavones and equol-producer status with coronary artery calcification (CAC), a biomarker of coronary atherosclerosis, among men in Japan. A population-based sample of 272 Japanese men aged 40–49 years recruited from 2004 to 2007 was examined for serum isoflavones, serum equol, CAC and other factors. Equol-producers were classified as individuals having a serum level of equol >83 nM. The presence of CAC was defined as a coronary Ca score ≥10 Agatston units. The associations of dietary isoflavones and equol-producers with CAC were analysed using multiple logistic regression. The median of dietary isoflavones, equol and CAC were 512·7 (interquartile range (IQR) 194·1, 1170·0), 9·1 (IQR 0·10, 33·1) and 0·0 (IQR 0·0, 1·0) nM, respectively. Prevalence of CAC and equol-producers was 9·6 and 16·0 %, respectively. Dietary isoflavones were not significantly associated with CAC. After multivariable adjustment, the OR for the presence of CAC in equol-producers compared with equol non-producers was 0·10 (95 % CI 0·01, 0·90, P < 0·04). Equol-producers had significantly lower CAC than equol non-producers, but there was no significant association between dietary isoflavones and CAC, suggesting that equol may be a key factor for atheroprotective properties of isoflavones in Japanese men. This finding must be confirmed in larger studies or clinical trials of equol that is now available as a dietary supplement.",2017 Jan
511,"Jeon H,Lee S",A CASE OF ADRENAL MYELOLIPOMA A PATIENT WITH BREAST CANCER.,"Background: Adrenal myelolipoma is a rare benign tumor composed of adipose tissue and hematopoetic elements resembling bone marrow. The majority of myelolipoma do not produce adrenal hormones and are only found as a result of evaluation for another disorder. With the widespread use of non-invasive abdominal imaging for various reason, its incidental detection has become more common. There are a few cases of breast cancer with concomitant adrenal myelolipoma in the literature. Case: A 43-year-old woman presented to endocrine clinic due to presurgical assessment of adrenal mass prior breast cancer surgery. Abdominal CT showed a 9 x 8 cm sized, lobulated contour heterogeneous fatty density mass with peripheral calcification in right adrenal gland. Hormonal studies for adrenal incidentaloma revealed: Aldosterone/Renin ratio, 0.70 ([normal range < 30]; normal DHEA-S, 85.0 µg/dL ([normal range, 80 -560 µg/dL]), ACTH 25 pg/mL ([normal range, 10 – 60 pg/mL]), morning serum cortisol 8.9 µg/dL ([normal range, 5 - 12 µg/dL]). In 24-hour urine, there revealed free cortisol 21.6 µg/day ([normal range, 10 – 50 µg/day); metanephrine 0.19 mg/day ([normal range < 0.8 mg/day]); 17-ketosteroid 14.06 mg/day ([normal range, 7 – 20 mg/day]). The hormonal results of adrenal mass revealed as nonfunctioning. The adrenal mass was surgically resected in order to rule out malignancy. Pathology report showed myelolipoma. Conclusion: We reported a case of adrenal myelolipoma coexisting with breast cancer where the diagnosis was made incidentally based on radiological features, treated with surgical resection.",2017 Jan-Mar

513,"Dawson S,Lawrie A","From bones to blood pressure, developing novel biologic approaches targeting the osteoprotegein pathway for pulmonary vascular disease.","Osteoprotegerin (tnfsf11b, OPG) is a soluble member of the TNF superfamily originally described as an important regulator of osteoclastogenesis almost 20 years ago. OPG is a heparin-binding secreted glycoprotein that exists as a 55–62 kDa monomer or a 110–120 kDa disulphide-linked homodimer. Acting as a soluble decoy receptor for RANKL, OPG actively regulates RANK signalling, and thereby osteoclastogenesis. OPG has subsequently been shown to also be a decoy receptor TNF related apoptosis inducing-ligand (tnfsf10, TRAIL, Apo2L). TRAIL is a type II transmembrane protein that is widely expressed in a variety of human tissues, including the spleen, lung, and prostate. Through binding to TRAIL, OPG can inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis of cancer cells. More recently, OPG has been demonstrated to be secreted by, and influence, vascular smooth muscle cells phenotype particularly related to vascular calcification and pulmonary vascular remodelling. In pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) suppression of BMP, induction of 5-HT and IL-1 signalling have been shown to stimulate the release of OPG in vitro, which causes cell migration and proliferation. Patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) demonstrate increased circulating and tissue levels of OPG, and circulating serum levels predict survival. In pre-clinical models, OPG levels correlate with disease severity. Since OPG is a naturally circulating protein, we are investigating the potential of novel biologic antibody therapies to rescue PAH phenotype in disease models. Further pre-clinical and mechanistic data are forthcoming, but we believe current published data identify OPG as an exciting and novel therapeutic target in PAH.",2017 Jan
514,"Lu X,Hu MC",Klotho/FGF23 Axis in Chronic Kidney Disease and Cardiovascular Disease.,"Background: Membrane αKlotho (hereinafter called Klotho) is highly expressed in the kidney and functions as a coreceptor of FGF receptors (FGFRs) to activate specific fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) signal pathway. FGF23 is produced in bones and participates in the maintenance of mineral homeostasis. The extracellular domain of transmembrane Klotho can be cleaved by secretases and released into the circulation as soluble Klotho. Soluble Klotho does not only weakly activate FGFRs to transduce the FGF23 signaling pathway, but also functions as an enzyme and hormonal substance to play a variety of biological functions. FGF23 exerts its biological effects through activation of FGFRs in a Klotho-dependent manner. However, extremely high FGF23 can exert its pathological action in a Klotho-independent manner. Summary: The decline in serum and urinary Klotho followed by a rise in serum FGF23 at an early stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) functions as an early biomarker for kidney dysfunction and can also serve as a predictor for risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in both CKD patients and the general population. Moreover, Klotho deficiency is a pathogenic factor for CKD progression and CVD. FGF23 may also contribute to CVD. Prevention of Klotho decline, reactivation of endogenous Klotho production, or supplementation of exogenous Klotho attenuate renal fibrosis, retard CKD progression, improve mineral metabolism, ameliorate cardiomyopathy, and alleviate vascular calcification in CKD. However, the poor CVD outcome after depletion of FGF23 with FGF23 antibody stimulates the generation of a more specific inhibitor of FGF23 for CKD treatment. Key Message: Klotho/FGF23 may not only be diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers for CKD and CVD, but are also pathogenic contributors to CKD progression and CVD development. The Klotho/FGF23 axis should be a novel target for renal clinics.",2017 Jul
515,"Lacson R,Goodrich ME,Harris K,Brawarsky P,Haas JS",Assessing Inaccuracies in Automated Information Extraction of Breast Imaging Findings.,"We previously identified breast imaging findings from radiology reports using an expert-based information extraction algorithm as part of the National Cancer Institute’s Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) initiative. We validate this algorithm and assess inaccuracies in a different institutional setting. Mammography, ultrasound (US), and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports of patients at an academic health system between 4/2013 and 6/2013 were included for analysis. Accuracy of automatically extracting imaging findings using an algorithm developed at a different institution compared to manual gold standard review is reported. Extraction errors are further categorized based on manual review. Precision and recall for extracting BI-RADS categories remain between 0.9 and 1.0, except for MRI (0.7). F measures for extracting other findings are 0.9 for non-mass enhancement (in MRI) and 0.8–0.9 for cysts (in MRI and US). Extracting breast imaging findings resulted in lowest accuracy for findings of calcification (range 0.4–0.6 in mammography) and asymmetric density (0.5–0.7 in mammography). Majority of errors for extracting imaging findings were due to qualifier-based errors, descriptors which indicate absence of findings, missed by automated extraction (e.g., “benign” calcifications). Our information extraction algorithm provides an effective approach to extracting some breast imaging findings for populating a breast screening registry. However, errors in information extraction when utilizing methods in new settings demonstrate that further work is necessary to extract information content from unstructured multi-institutional radiology reports.",2017 Apr
516,"Yabusaki K,Hutcheson JD,Vyas P,Bertazzo S,Body SC,Aikawa M,Aikawa E",Quantification of Calcified Particles in Human Valve Tissue Reveals Asymmetry of Calcific Aortic Valve Disease Development.,"Recent studies indicated that small calcified particles observable by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) may initiate calcification in cardiovascular tissues. We hypothesized that if the calcified particles precede gross calcification observed in calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), they would exhibit a regional asymmetric distribution associated with CAVD development, which always initiates at the base of aortic valve leaflets adjacent to the aortic outflow in a region known as the fibrosa. Testing this hypothesis required counting the calcified particles in histological sections of aortic valve leaflets. SEM images, however, do not provide high contrast between components within images, making the identification and quantification of particles buried within tissue extracellular matrix difficult. We designed a new unique pattern-matching based technique to allow for flexibility in recognizing particles by creating a gap zone in the detection criteria that decreased the influence of non-particle image clutter in determining whether a particle was identified. We developed this flexible pattern particle-labeling (FpPL) technique using synthetic test images and human carotid artery tissue sections. A conventional image particle counting method (preinstalled in ImageJ) did not properly recognize small calcified particles located in noisy images that include complex extracellular matrix structures and other commonly used pattern-matching methods failed to detect the wide variation in size, shape, and brightness exhibited by the particles. Comparative experiments with the ImageJ particle counting method demonstrated that our method detected significantly more (p < 2 × 10−7) particles than the conventional method with significantly fewer (p < 0.0003) false positives and false negatives (p < 0.0003). We then applied the FpPL technique to CAVD leaflets and showed a significant increase in detected particles in the fibrosa at the base of the leaflets (p < 0.0001), supporting our hypothesis. The outcomes of this study are twofold: (1) development of a new image analysis technique that can be adapted to a wide range of applications and (2) acquisition of new insight on potential early mediators of calcification in CAVD.",2016
517,"Ibrahim R,Rahmat K,Fadzli F,Rozalli FI,Westerhout CJ,Alli K,Vijayananthan A,Moosa F",Evaluation of solid breast lesions with power Doppler: value of penetrating vessels as a predictor of malignancy.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the vascular pattern of solid breast lesions using power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS) and assess whether the presence of intratumoural penetrating vessels can predict breast cancer malignancy. METHODS: Greyscale ultrasonography (US) and PDUS were prospectively performed on 91 women in Malaysia with histopathologically proven breast lesions. The diagnostic accuracy of greyscale US, PDUS, and both greyscale US and PDUS was calculated and compared. RESULTS: The 91 women had 102 breast lesions (55 benign, 47 malignant). Of the 47 malignant lesions, 36 demonstrated intratumoural penetrating vessels. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of greyscale US findings in diagnosing malignancy were 100.0%, 71.4%, 74.1% and 100.0%, respectively. The presence of calcification in the breast lesion and the margin, shape and posterior acoustic features of the lesion were significant parameters in predicting malignancy (p < 0.01). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the presence of intratumoural penetrating vessels in predicting malignancy were 76.5%, 80.0%, 76.5% and 80.0%, respectively. When both greyscale US and PDUS were used, there was a significant correlation in predicting malignancy (p < 0.05). The specificity and PPV values of the combined greyscale US and PDUS method (89.0% and 85.7%, respectively) were higher than those of greyscale US or PDUS alone. CONCLUSION: Flow patterns revealed by PDUS can be useful for differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions. The visualisation of penetrating vessels in solid breast lesions can be used to complement greyscale US findings in predicting malignancy.",2016 Nov

In this prospective study, we aimed to determine the mammographic findings of screen-detected cancers and discuss the efficacy of breast cancer screening in a developing country. METHODS: A total of 6912 women were screened in three rounds. The radiologic findings were grouped as mass, focal asymmetry, calcification, and architectural distortion. Masses were classified according to shape, border, and density. Calcifications were grouped according to morphology and distribution. Cancers were grouped according to the clinical stage. RESULTS: Seventy cancers were detected with an incidence of 4.8/1000. Two cancers were detected in other centers and three were not visualized mammographically. Mammographic presentations of the remaining 65 cancers were mass (47.7%, n=31), calcification (30.8%, n=20), focal asymmetry (16.9%, n=11), architectural distortion (3.1%, n=2), and skin thickening (1.5%, n=1). The numbers of stage 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 cancers were 13 (20.0%), 34 (52.3%), 14 (21.5%), 3 (4.6%), and 1 (1.5%), respectively. The numbers of interval and missed cancers were 5 (7.4%) and 7 (10.3%), respectively. CONCLUSION: A high incidence of early breast cancer has been detected. The incidence of missed and interval cancers did not show major differences from western screening trials. We believe that this study will pioneer implementation of efficient population-based mammographic screenings in developing countries.",2016 Nov

We examined the relationship between calcifications and breast cancer prognostic factors in the population-based Carolina Mammography Registry (CMR). Methods: This study included 8,472 invasive breast cancers diagnosed in the CMR between 1996-2011 where information regarding calcifications occurring within two years of diagnosis was reported. Calcification-specific Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessments were reported prospectively by a radiologist. Tumor characteristic data were obtained from the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry and/or pathology reports. Multivariable-adjusted associations between the presence of calcifications in the breast affected by cancer and tumor characteristics were estimated using logistic regression. Statistical tests were two-sided. Results: The presence of calcifications was positively associated with tumors that were high grade (vs. low, odds ratio (OR)=1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-1.88) or had an in situ component (vs. without, OR=2.15, 95%CI 1.81-2.55). Calcifications were inversely associated with hormone receptor-negative (vs. positive, OR=0.73, 95%CI 0.57-0.93), >35mm (vs. ≤8mm, OR=0.47, 95%CI 0.37-0.61), and lobular (vs. ductal, OR=0.39, 95%CI 0.22-0.69) tumors. The association between the presence of calcifications and an in situ component was limited to BI-RADS 4 and 5 calcifications and was absent for BI-RADS 2 or 3 (P-heterogeneity<0.01). The association with tumor size was strongest for BI-RADS 3 and 4 (P-heterogeneity<0.01). Conclusion: Calcifications were associated with both unfavorable (high grade) and favorable (small size, hormone receptor-positive) prognostic factors. Detailed analysis of calcification biological features is necessary to understand the mechanisms driving these associations.",2017 Jan 01
521,"Scott R,Stone N,Kendall C,Geraki K,Rogers K",Relationships between pathology and crystal structure in breast calcifications: an in situ X-ray diffraction study in histological sections.,"Calcifications are not only one of the most important early diagnostic markers of breast cancer, but are also increasingly believed to aggravate the proliferation of cancer cells and invasion of surrounding tissue. Moreover, this influence appears to vary with calcification composition. Despite this, remarkably little is known about the composition and crystal structure of the most common type of breast calcifications, and how this differs between benign and malignant lesions. We sought to determine how the phase composition and crystallographic parameters within calcifications varies with pathology, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. This is the first time crystallite size and lattice parameters have been measured in breast calcifications, and we found that these both parallel closely the changes in these parameters with age observed in fetal bone. We also discovered that these calcifications contain a small proportion of magnesium whitlockite, and that this proportion increases from benign to in situ to invasive cancer. When combined with other recent evidence on the effect of magnesium on hydroxyapatite precipitation, this suggests a mechanism explaining observations that carbonate levels within breast calcifications are lower in malignant specimens.",2016

523,Borrás T,A single gene connects stiffness in glaucoma and the vascular system.,"Arterial calcification results in arterial stiffness and higher systolic blood pressure. Arterial calcification is prevented by the high expression of the Matrix-Gla gene (MGP) in the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) of the arteries' tunica media. Originally, MGP, a gene highly expressed in cartilage and VSMC, was found to be one of the top expressed genes in the trabecular meshwork. The creation of an Mgp-lacZ Knock-In mouse and the use of mouse genetics revealed that in the eye, Mgp's abundant expression is localized and restricted to glaucoma-associated tissues from the anterior and posterior segments. In particular, it is specifically expressed in the regions of the trabecular meshwork and of the peripapillary sclera that surrounds the optic nerve. Because stiffness in these tissues would significantly alter outflow facility and biomechanical scleral stress in the optic nerve head (ONH), we propose MGP as a strong candidate for the regulation of stiffness in glaucoma. MGP further illustrates the presence of a common function affecting key glaucomatous parameters in the front and back of the eye, and thus offers the possibility for a sole therapeutic target for the disease.",2017 May

Shear-wave elastography (SWE) can evaluate tissue stiffness and complement conventional ultrasound in diagnosing malignant nodules. However, calcification of nodules may affect the results of SWE. The purposes of this study are to compare the differences of shear-wave speed (SWS) measurement among different calcification groups and compare the diagnostic performance between using a single uniform SWS cutoff value and multiple individual calcification-specific cutoff values using technique of point SWS measurement. We retrospectively identified 517 thyroid nodules (346 benign and 171 malignant nodules) examined by conventional ultrasound and point SWS measurement. There were 177 non-calcified, 159 micro-calcified and 181 macro-calcified nodules. The diagnostic performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) was computed. The mean SWS in malignant nodules more than doubled that of benign nodules (4.81±2.03 m/s vs. 2.29±0.99 m/s, p<0.001). The mean SWS of nodules progressively increased from the non-calcification (2.60±1.49 m/s), to micro-calcification (3.27±1.85 m/s) and to macro-calcification (3.68±2.26 m/s) groups (p<0.001), which was true in both the benign and malignant nodules. If we used individual SWS cutoff values for non- (SWS >2.42 m/s), micro- (SWS >2.88 m/s) and macro-calcification (SWS >3.59 m/s) nodules in the whole group, the AUC was 0.859 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.826-0.888), which was significantly better than the AUC of 0.816 (95% CI, 0.780-0.848) if a single uniform cutoff value (SWS >2.72 m/s) was applied to all the nodules regardless of calcification status (p=0.011).

526,"Pavlatou MG,Remaley AT,Gold PW","Klotho: a humeral mediator in CSF and plasma that influences longevity and susceptibility to multiple complex disorders, including depression.","Klotho is a hormone secreted into human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma and urine that promotes longevity and influences the onset of several premature senescent phenotypes in mice and humans, including atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, stroke and osteoporosis. Preliminary studies also suggest that Klotho possesses tumor suppressor properties. Klotho's roles in these phenomena were first suggested by studies demonstrating that a defect in the Klotho gene in mice results in a significant decrease in lifespan. The Klotho-deficient mouse dies prematurely at 8–9 weeks of age. At 4–5 weeks of age, a syndrome resembling human ageing emerges consisting of atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, cognitive disturbances and alterations of hippocampal architecture. Several deficits in Klotho-deficient mice are likely to contribute to these phenomena. These include an inability to defend against oxidative stress in the central nervous system and periphery, decreased capacity to generate nitric oxide to sustain normal endothelial reactivity, defective Klotho-related mediation of glycosylation and ion channel regulation, increased insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling and a disturbed calcium and phosphate homeostasis accompanied by altered vitamin D levels and ectopic calcification. Identifying the mechanisms by which Klotho influences multiple important pathways is an emerging field in human biology that will contribute significantly to understanding basic physiologic processes and targets for the treatment of complex diseases. Because many of the phenomena seen in Klotho-deficient mice occur in depressive illness, major depression and bipolar disorder represent illnesses potentially associated with Klotho dysregulation. Klotho's presence in CSF, blood and urine should facilitate its study in clinical populations.",2016 Aug

METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed 52 consecutive tumors in 50 patients with pathologically proven pure DCIS who underwent [F-18] FDG-PET/CT before surgery. [F-18] FDG-PET/CT was performed after biopsy in all patients. The mean interval from biopsy to [F-18] FDG-PET/CT was 29.2 d. [F-18] FDG uptake by visual analysis and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was compared with clinicopathological characteristics. RESULTS: [F-18] FDG uptake was visualized in 28 lesions (53.8%) and the mean and standard deviation of SUVmax was 1.63 and 0.90. On univariate analysis, visual analysis and the SUVmax were associated with symptomatic presentation (P = 0.012 and 0.002, respectively), palpability (P = 0.030 and 0.024, respectively), use of core-needle biopsy (CNB) (P = 0.023 and 0.012, respectively), ultrasound-guided biopsy (P = 0.040 and 0.006, respectively), enhancing lesion ≥ 20 mm on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (P = 0.001 and 0.010, respectively), tumor size ≥ 20 mm on histopathology (P = 0.002 and 0.008, respectively). However, [F-18] FDG uptake parameters were not significantly associated with age, presence of calcification on mammography, mass formation on MRI, presence of comedo necrosis, hormone status (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2), and nuclear grade. The factors significantly associated with visual analysis and SUVmax were symptomatic presentation (P = 0.019 and 0.001, respectively), use of CNB (P = 0.001 and 0.031, respectively), and enhancing lesion ≥ 20 mm on MRI (P = 0.001 and 0.049, respectively) on multivariate analysis.

A number of studies highlighted the role of these cells in age-related diseases, including those characterized by ectopic calcification. Nevertheless, their use in clinical practice is still controversial, mainly due to difficulties in finding reproducible and accurate methods for their determination. Methods: Circulating mature cells (CMC, CD45-, CD34+, CD133-) and circulating progenitor cells (CPC, CD45dim, CD34bright, CD133+) were investigated by polychromatic high-speed flow cytometry to detect the expression of endothelial (CD309+) or osteogenic (BAP+) differentiation markers in healthy subjects and in patients affected by peripheral vascular manifestations associated with ectopic calcification. Results: This study shows that: 1) polychromatic flow cytometry represents a valuable tool to accurately identify rare cells; 2) the balance of CD309+ on CMC/CD309+ on CPC is altered in patients affected by peripheral vascular manifestations, suggesting the occurrence of vascular damage and low repair potential; 3) the increase of circulating cells exhibiting a shift towards an osteoblast-like phenotype (BAP+) is observed in the presence of ectopic calcification. Conclusion: Differences between healthy subjects and patients with ectopic calcification indicate that this approach may be useful to better evaluate endothelial dysfunction in a clinical context.",2016
529,"Hu X,Zhao J,Qian H,Du G,Kelly M,Yang H",Radiological and pathological analysis of LDCT screen detected and surgically resected sub-centimetre lung nodules in 44 asymptomatic patients.,"Purpose: Once lung cancer is detected due to clinical symptoms or by being visible on chest X-ray, it is usually high stage and non-operable. In order to improve mortality rates in lung cancer, low-dose CT (LDCT) screening of “high risk” individuals is gaining popularity. However, the rate of malignancy in LDCT detected sub-centimetre lung nodules is not clear. We aimed to analyze surgically resected specimens in this patient group to explore cost effectiveness and recommendations for clinical management of these nodules. Material & methods: Our hospital pathology database was searched for sub-centimeter lung nodules detected by LDCT screening which were resected. The patient demographics were collected and the radiologic and pathologic characteristics of those nodules were analyzed. Results: From the records, 44 patients with 46 resected subcentimetre nodules were identified. Patients were selected for surgery based on an irregular shape, growth in size during follow up, family history of lung cancer or personal history of cancer of other sites, previous lung disease, smoking and personal anxiety. Of the 44 patients, 33 were women and the ages ranged from 43 to 76 years (56.75 ± 8.44). All nodules were equal to, or less than 10 mm with a mean diameter of 7.81 ± 1.80 mm (SD). Out of 46 nodules, the pathological diagnoses were: invasive adenocarcinoma (ACa) in 4 (8.7%); adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) in 29 (63%); benign fibrosis/fibrotic scar with inflammation or calcification in 12 (26.1%); an intrapulmonary benign lymph node in 1 (2.2%). Of the ACa, AIS and AAH groups (a total of 31 patients), 77% were women (24 vs. 7). The cancer or pre-cancer nodules (ACa, AIS and AAH) tended to be larger than benign fibrotic scars (P = 0.039). Amongst all characteristics, significant statistical differences were found when the following radiological features were considered: reconstructed nodule shape (P = 0.011), margin (P = 0.003) and ground glass pattern (P = 0.000). The patient’s age, the axial morphology of the lesion, relationship to major vessels or visceral pleura and location within the lung parenchyma were not predictive of the pathologic diagnosis. Only one of the 31 patients with a cancer or pre-cancer nodule was a smoker. Conclusion: ACa, AIS and AAH nodules detected on LDCT included more women (77%) than men in our cohort. Smoking as inclusive criteria for LDCT screening of lung cancer needs to be further evaluated in the Chinese population. The reconstructed nodule shape, density and margin may help radiologists to identify small cancer and pre-cancer nodules from benign conditions.",2016

A total of 142 patients with pathologically confirmed DCIS were initially included in the study. The patients underwent preoperative examination by conventional ultrasound and by ABVS. The BI-RADS category system was used to identify benign and malignant lesions, after which breast conservation surgery was performed, and the therapeutic effects were compared. DCIS lesions were found in each quadrant of the breasts. Typical symptoms included: Duct ectasia and filling in 23 cases, mass (mainly solid, occasionally cystic, with or without calcification) in 38 cases, hypoechoic area (with or without calcification) in 33 cases, calcifications (simple) in 23 cases, and architectural distortion in 17 cases. In addition, 110 cases (82.1%) were detected as grade ≥4 according to the BI-RADS category, and 92 cases (68.7%) were considered malignant lesions following conventional ultrasound scanning. The detection rate of ABVS was significantly higher than that of conventional ultrasound (χ2=268.000, P<0.001). The average tumor diameter was 2.5±0.8 cm using ABVS and 2.0±0.9 cm using conventional ultrasound (the former being significantly higher than the latter; t=6.325, P=0.034). Eight patients (5.6%) had recurrences of the cancer, and the tumor diameter in the 8 patients was significantly larger using ABVS as compared to conventional ultrasound. In the diagnosis of DCIS, ABVS was superior to conventional ultrasound scanner in guiding breast conservation surgery and predicting recurrence. However, large-scale studies are required for confirmation of the findings.",2016 Oct

The presence of matrix Gla protein was reported in arterial and venous walls, lungs, kidney, uterus, heart, tooth cementum and eyes. Several studies identified matrix Gla protein in tumoral pathology.Until recently, it was thought to only have an inhibitory role of physiological and ectopic calcification. New studies demonstrated that it also has a role in physiological and pathological angiogenesis, as well as in tumorigenesis.The aim of this review is to report the latest findings related to the expression and clinical implications of matrix Gla protein in different types of cancer with an emphasis on cerebral tumors.",2016
532,"Gala FB,Aswani Y",Imaging in spinal posterior epidural space lesions: A pictorial essay.,"Spinal epidural space is a real anatomic space located outside the dura mater and within the spinal canal extending from foramen magnum to sacrum. Important contents of this space are epidural fat, spinal nerves, epidural veins and arteries. Due to close proximity of posterior epidural space to spinal cord and spinal nerves, the lesions present with symptoms of radiculopathy and/or myelopathy. In this pictorial essay, detailed anatomy of the posterior epidural space, pathologies affecting it along with imaging pearls to accurately diagnose them are discussed. Various pathologies affecting the posterior epidural space either arising from the space itself or occurring secondary to vertebral/intervertebral disc pathologies. Primary spinal bone tumors affecting the posterior epidural space have been excluded. The etiological spectrum affecting the posterior epidural space ranges from degenerative, infective, neoplastic - benign or malignant to miscellaneous pathologies. MRI is the modality of choice in evaluation of these lesions with CT scan mainly helpful in detecting calcification. Due to its excellent soft tissue contrast, Magnetic Resonance Imaging is extremely useful in assessing the pathologies of posterior epidural space, to know their entire extent, characterize them and along with clinical history and laboratory data, arrive at a specific diagnosis and guide the referring clinician. It is important to diagnose these lesions early so as to prevent permanent neurological complication.",2016 Jul-Sep

Midkine (MK), a new heparin-binding growth factor, plays important roles in a variety of biological phenomena such as carcinogenesis, inflammation, and angiogenesis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate serum midkine (SMK) and nodular midkine (NMK) levels in patients with thyroid nodules to predict malignancy and whether there was any association between. Methods. A total of 105 patients (74 women, 31 men) with thyroid nodules were enrolled. The levels of SMK and NMK were measured. Any possible correlation between SMK, NMK, and biochemical, cytopathological, or radiological variables was investigated. Results. Both SMK and NMK were found to be higher in hypoechoic nodules with an irregular border and without a halo (p < 0.05). Serum MK levels were significantly higher in nodules with microcalcifications than nodules with macrocalcification or without calcification (p = 0.001). SMK levels were found to be correlated with NMK levels (SMK 0.63 ng/ml versus 1.04 ng/mL and NMK 0.55 ng/mL versus 0.55 ng/mL, r2 = 0.54, p < 0.001). Conclusion. Both SMK and NMK can predict tumorigenesis of highly malignant/suspicious thyroid cytopathology and also well correlated with sonographic features of thyroid nodules. We suggest that MK levels may serve as an alternative biomarker, in conjunction with the cytopathological results in preoperative assessment of thyroid nodules.",2016

However, only few studies have investigated the associations between the imaging features of breast cancer and the results of multigene expression assays. Our study was to identify the relationship between imaging features on ultrasound (US) and the recurrence score (RS) on a 21-gene expression assay in patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. 267 patients with ER-positive, HER-negative invasive breast cancer who underwent examinations using US and Oncotype DX assay were included. US images were independently reviewed by dedicated breast radiologists who were blind to the RS. Tumour roundness was measured using a laboratory-developed software program. The pathological data were reviewed, including immunohistochemistry results. Univariate analysis was performed to assess the associations between the RS and each variable. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of high RS. Of 267 patients, 147 (55%) had low, 96 (36%) intermediate, and 24 (9%) had high RS. According to the univariate analysis, parallel orientation, presence of calcification in the mass, and tumour roundness were positively associated with high RS. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that parallel orientation (OR = 5.53) and tumour roundness (OR = 1.70 per 10 increase) were associated with high RS. Parallel orientation and tumour roundness are independent variables that may predict high RS in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.",2016

Of these, 18 patients underwent a CT scan and 9 patients underwent an MRI. All patients underwent unenhanced and contrast-enhanced examinations; 1 patient underwent multiphrase CT enhancement examination. Imaging characteristics, including location, shape, size, number, edge, and attenuation or intensity of each lesion, both unenhanced and contrast enhanced, were analyzed.Of the 27 cases, 24 were solitary, 2 had 2 nodules, and 1 had multiple confluent tumors. The lesion with multiple confluent tumors was ill defined and irregular; the other lesions were oval or round, well-defined nodules or masses. The unenhanced CT images showed 19 homogenous isodense lesions. There was no calcification in any of the patients. The contrast-enhanced CT images showed intermediate and marked nonhomogeneous enhancement in 13 lesions, intermediate homogeneous enhancement in 4 lesions, and a mild heterogeneous enhancement in 2 lesions. MR T1-weighted images revealed 1 ill-defined and 9 well-defined homogeneous isointense lesions. T2-weighted images showed homogeneous hyperintensity to the muscles in 6 lesions, 3 mild hyperintense lesions with hypointense lesions, and 1 mixed, mild hyperintense and isointense lesion. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images demonstrated intermediate and marked nonhomogeneous enhancement in 9 lesions and intermediate homogeneous enhancement in 1 lesion.DFSP is characterized by a subcutaneous well-defined soft tissue nodule or mass on plain CT/MR scans, and shows intermediate-to-marked enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT/MR scans. The imaging findings for DFSP are nonspecific, but may help to define the diagnosis in an appropriate clinical setting.",2015 Jun

Achievements from F-18 NaF PET/CT are: higher sensitivity of positron imaging, higher target background ratio with higher tracer accumulation in bone hydroxyapatite and higher specificity through CT correlation. These properties have also given directions to new research fields based on imaging microcalcifications, very recently. A limited number of cases have reported the F-18 NaF uptake in macrocalcified soft tissue metastases.

Enhanced cell-cell adhesion is a common mechanism of cellular aggregation, but its role in calcific lesion formation is not known. Cadherin-11 (Cad-11) has been associated with lesion formation in vitro, but its function during adult valve homeostasis and pathogenesis is not known. This study aims to elucidate the specific functions of Cad-11 and its downstream targets RhoA and Sox9 in extracellular matrix remodeling and aortic valve calcification. Approach and Results: We conditionally overexpressed Cad-11 in murine heart valves using a novel double transgenic Nfatc1Cre;R26-Cad11Tg/Tg mouse model. These mice developed hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis with prominent calcific lesions in the aortic valve leaflets. Cad-11 overexpression upregulated downstream targets RhoA and Sox9 in the valve interstitial cells, causing calcification and extensive pathogenic extracellular matrix remodeling. Aortic valve interstitial cells overexpressing Cad-11 in an osteogenic environment in vitro rapidly form calcific nodules analogous to in vivo lesions. Molecular analyses revealed upregulation of osteoblastic and myofibroblastic markers. Treatment with a ROCK inhibitor attenuated nodule formation, further supporting that Cad-11 driven calcification acts through the small GTPase RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. Conclusions: This study identifies one of the underlying molecular mechanisms of heart valve calcification and demonstrates that overexpression of Cad-11 upregulates RhoA and Sox9 to induce calcification and extracellular matrix remodeling in adult aortic valve pathogenesis. The findings provide a potential molecular target for clinical treatment.",2016 Aug
539,"Page MJ,Green S,Mrocki MA,Surace SJ,Deitch J,McBain B,Lyttle N,Buchbinder R",Electrotherapy modalities for rotator cuff disease.,"Background: Management of rotator cuff disease may include use of electrotherapy modalities (also known as electrophysical agents), which aim to reduce pain and improve function via an increase in energy (electrical, sound, light, or thermal) into the body. Examples include therapeutic ultrasound, low‐level laser therapy (LLLT), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF). These modalities are usually delivered as components of a physical therapy intervention. This review is one of a series of reviews that form an update of the Cochrane review, 'Physiotherapy interventions for shoulder pain'. Objectives: To synthesise available evidence regarding the benefits and harms of electrotherapy modalities for the treatment of people with rotator cuff disease. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2015), Ovid EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2015), CINAHL Plus (EBSCOhost, January 1937 to March 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP clinical trials registries up to March 2015, unrestricted by language, and reviewed the reference lists of review articles and retrieved trials, to identify potentially relevant trials. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials, including adults with rotator cuff disease (e.g. subacromial impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendinitis, calcific tendinitis), and comparing any electrotherapy modality with placebo, no intervention, a different electrotherapy modality or any other intervention (e.g. glucocorticoid injection). Trials investigating whether electrotherapy modalities were more effective than placebo or no treatment, or were an effective addition to another physical therapy intervention (e.g. manual therapy or exercise) were the main comparisons of interest. Main outcomes of interest were overall pain, function, pain on motion, patient‐reported global assessment of treatment success, quality of life and the number of participants experiencing adverse events. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for the main outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included 47 trials (2388 participants). Most trials (n = 43) included participants with rotator cuff disease without calcification (four trials included people with calcific tendinitis). Sixteen (34%) trials investigated the effect of an electrotherapy modality delivered in isolation. Only 23% were rated at low risk of allocation bias, and 49% were rated at low risk of both performance and detection bias (for self‐reported outcomes). The trials were heterogeneous in terms of population, intervention and comparator, so none of the data could be combined in a meta‐analysis.In one trial (61 participants; low quality evidence), pulsed therapeutic ultrasound (three to five times a week for six weeks) was compared with placebo (inactive ultrasound therapy) for calcific tendinitis. At six weeks, the mean reduction in overall pain with placebo was ‐6.3 points on a 52‐point scale, and ‐14.9 points with ultrasound (MD ‐8.60 points, 95% CI ‐13.48 to ‐3.72 points; absolute risk difference 17%, 7% to 26% more). Mean improvement in function with placebo was 3.7 points on a 100‐point scale, and 17.8 points with ultrasound (mean difference (MD) 14.10 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.39 to 22.81 points; absolute risk difference 14%, 5% to 23% more). Ninety‐one per cent (29/32) of participants reported treatment success with ultrasound compared with 52% (15/29) of participants receiving placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.53; absolute risk difference 39%, 18% to 60% more). Mean improvement in quality of life with placebo was 0.40 points on a 10‐point scale, and 2.60 points with ultrasound (MD 2.20 points, 95% CI 0.91 points to 3.49 points; absolute risk difference 22%, 9% to 35% more). Between‐group differences were not important at nine months. No participant reported adverse events.Therapeutic ultrasound produced no clinically important additional benefits when combined with other physical therapy interventions (eight clinically heterogeneous trials, low quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there are differences in patient‐important outcomes between ultrasound and other active interventions (manual therapy, acupuncture, glucocorticoid injection, glucocorticoid injection plus oral tolmetin sodium, or exercise) because the quality of evidence is very low. Two placebo‐controlled trials reported results favouring LLLT up to three weeks (low quality evidence), however combining LLLT with other physical therapy interventions produced few additional benefits (10 clinically heterogeneous trials, low quality evidence). We are uncertain whether transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is more or less effective than glucocorticoid injection with respect to pain, function, global treatment success and active range of motion because of the very low quality evidence from a single trial. In other single, small trials, no clinically important benefits of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF), microcurrent electrical stimulation (MENS), acetic acid iontophoresis and microwave diathermy were observed (low or very low quality evidence).No adverse events of therapeutic ultrasound, LLLT, TENS or microwave diathermy were reported by any participants. Adverse events were not measured in any trials investigating the effects of PEMF, MENS or acetic acid iontophoresis. Authors' conclusions: Based on low quality evidence, therapeutic ultrasound may have short‐term benefits over placebo in people with calcific tendinitis, and LLLT may have short‐term benefits over placebo in people with rotator cuff disease. Further high quality placebo‐controlled trials are needed to confirm these results. In contrast, based on low quality evidence, PEMF may not provide clinically relevant benefits over placebo, and therapeutic ultrasound, LLLT and PEMF may not provide additional benefits when combined with other physical therapy interventions. We are uncertain whether TENS is superior to placebo, and whether any electrotherapy modality provides benefits over other active interventions (e.g. glucocorticoid injection) because of the very low quality of the evidence. Practitioners should communicate the uncertainty of these effects and consider other approaches or combinations of treatment. Further trials of electrotherapy modalities for rotator cuff disease should be based upon a strong rationale and consideration of whether or not they would alter the conclusions of this review.",2016 Jun
540,Promsopa C,Septochoanal polyp with osseous metaplasia: a case report.,"Background: Polyps originating from the posterior septum with choanal extension, also known as “septochoanal polyps,” are uncommon, and septochoanal polyps with central calcification are extremely rare. We report the second case of septochoanal polyps with central calcification in the English literature. Case presentation: A 55-year-old Thai woman presented with a progressive left-side nasal obstruction. An examination of her nose revealed an irregular lobulated mass, yellow in color, with a smooth surface that arose from her posterior nasal septum and extended down to her nasopharynx. Computed tomography revealed a large choanal mass with a central ossified structure. A punch biopsy was performed and microscopic examination showed an inflammatory polyp. The mass was removed using an endoscopic surgery technique, and the histology of this lesion confirmed a typical presentation of choanal polyps. Conclusions: Although septochoanal polyps with osseous metaplasia are known to be very rare, physicians should be aware of them and include them in the differential diagnosis of choanal mass with central calcification lesions.",2016

Once symptoms develop, there is an inexorable deterioration with a poor prognosis; currently there are no therapies capable of modifying disease progression, and aortic valve replacement is the only available treatment. Our goal is to study the progression of calcification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) and get new insights at molecular level that could help in the understanding of this disease. In this work, we analyzed consecutive slices from aortic valve tissue by MALDI-IMS, to establish the spatial distribution of proteins and peptides directly from the surface of the histological sections. The analysis showed different structures corresponding to regions observed in conventional histology, including large calcification areas and zones rich in collagen and elastic fibers. Peptide extraction from the tissue, followed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis, provided the identification of collagen VI α-3 and NDRG2 proteins which correlated with the masses obtained by MALDI-IMS and were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. These results highlighted the molecular mechanism implied in AS using MALDI-IMS, a novel technique never used before in this pathology. In addition, we can define specific regions proving a complementary resolution of the molecular histology.",2016

We hypothesised that CPB may be pathogenic entities and even a cause of cardiovascular calcification. Here we revealed that CPB isolated from calcified atherosclerotic plaques and artificially synthesised CPB are morphologically and chemically indistinguishable entities. Their formation is accelerated along with the increase in calcium salts-phosphates/serum concentration ratio. Experiments in vitro and in vivo showed that pathogenic effects of CPB are defined by apoptosis-mediated endothelial toxicity but not by direct tissue calcification or functional changes in anti-calcification proteins. Since the factors underlying the formation of CPB and their pathogenic mechanism closely resemble those responsible for atherosclerosis development, further research in this direction may help us to uncover triggers of this disease.",2016

A total of 367 consecutive breast cancer patients with cT1–2NxM0 who underwent breast conserving surgery and axillary lymph node dissection followed by whole breast irradiation were enrolled. We evaluated the pathologic tumor and node status, tumor differentiation, calcification, and lymphovascular invasion, the status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR1), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), the expression of E-cadherin, P53, and Ki-67 index. Totally, 108 (29.4%) of the 367 patients had positive axillary lymph nodes. An increased tumor size (P = 0.024), the presence of lymphovascular invasion (P < 0.001), and Ki-67 index of >20% (P = 0.038) were significantly associated with axillary lymph node metastases on the multivariate analysis. In our study, 86.2% of the patients with all the unfavorable factors had an involvement of axillary nodal metastases, and only 12.2% of the patients with all the favorable predictors had positive axillary nodes. The predictive power was significant on the receiver operating curve (P < 0.001). We found that several factors, such as tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, and the Ki-67 index, are independent factors that predict positive ALNM on multivariate analysis for the patients with cT1–2 breast cancer. Clinicians simply could predict the probability of ALNM after verifying the molecular and clinical factors in early breast cancer.",2016 May

In this paper, we review the basics of SWI, including data acquisition, data reconstruction and post-processing. In particular, the source of cusp artifacts in phase images is investigated in detail and an improved multi-channel phase data combination algorithm is provided. In addition, we show a few clinical applications of SWI for imaging stroke, traumatic brain injury, carotid vessel wall, siderotic nodules in cirrhotic liver, prostate cancer, prostatic calcification, spinal cord injury and intervertebral disc degeneration. As the clinical applications of SWI continue to expand both in and outside the brain, improving SWI in conjunction with QSM is an important future direction of this technology.",2017 Apr

In this work, we fabricated biocompatible and safe chitosan (CS)/hyaluronic acid (HA) nanoparticles (NPs) to deliver microRNA-21 (miR-21), which has been proved to accelerate osteogenesis in hBMMSCs; then, the CS/HA/miR-21 NPs were cross-linked onto the surfaces of culture plates with 0.2% gel solution to fabricate miR-21-functionalized culture plates for reverse transfection. hBMMSC sheets were induced continuously for 14 days using a vitamin C-rich method on the miR-21-functionalized culture plates. For the characterization of CS/HA/miR-21 NPs, the particle size, zeta potential, surface morphology, and gel retardation were sequentially investigated. Then, the biological effects of hBMMSC sheets on the miR-21-functionalized culture plates were evaluated. The assay results demonstrated that the hBMMSC sheets could be successfully induced via the novel reverse transfection approach, and miR-21 delivery significantly enhanced the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hBMMSC sheets in terms of upregulating calcification-related gene expression and enhancing alkaline phosphatase production, collagen secretion, and mineralized nodule formation.

In apparent contrast, hypovitaminosis D has been reported in patients with primary brain calcifications (“Fahr’s disease”). We evaluated the expression of two phosphate transporters which we have found to be associated with primary brain calcification (SLC20A2, whose promoter has a predicted vitamin D receptor binding site, and XPR1), and one unassociated (SLC20A1), in an in vitro model of calcification. Expression of all three genes was significantly decreased in calcifying human bone osteosarcoma (SaOs-2) cells. Further, we confirmed that vitamin D (calcitriol) reduced calcification as measured by Alizarin Red staining. Cells incubated with calcitriol under calcifying conditions specifically maintained expression of the phosphate transporter SLC20A2 at higher levels relative to controls, by RT-qPCR. Neither SLC20A1 nor XPR1 were affected by calcitriol treatment and remained suppressed. Critically, knockdown of SLC20A2 gene and protein with CRISPR technology in SaOs2 cells significantly ablated vitamin D mediated inhibition of calcification. This study elucidates the mechanistic importance of SLC20A2 in suppressing the calcification process. It also suggests that vitamin D might be used to regulate SLC20A2 gene expression, as well as reduce brain calcification which occurs in Fahr’s disease and normal aging.",2016

While extensively studied in plants, relatively little is known about smRNAs and their targets in marine phytoplankton, such as Emiliania huxleyi (E. huxleyi). Deep sequencing was performed of smRNAs extracted at different time points as E. huxleyi cells transition from logarithmic to stationary phase growth in batch culture. Computational analyses predicted 18 E. huxleyi specific miRNAs. The 18 miRNA candidates and their precursors vary in length (18–24 nt and 71–252 nt, respectively), genome copy number (3–1,459), and the number of genes targeted (2–107). Stem-loop real time reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR was used to validate miRNA expression which varied by nearly three orders of magnitude when growth slows and cells enter stationary phase. Stem-loop RT PCR was also used to examine the expression profiles of miRNA in calcifying and non-calcifying cultures, and a small subset was found to be differentially expressed when nutrients become limiting and calcification is enhanced. In addition to miRNAs, endogenous small RNAs such as ra-siRNAs, ta-siRNAs, nat-siRNAs, and piwiRNAs were predicted along with the machinery for the biogenesis and processing of si-RNAs. This study is the first genome-wide investigation smRNAs pathways in E. huxleyi. Results provide new insights into the importance of smRNAs in regulating aspects of physiological growth and adaptation in marine phytoplankton and further challenge the notion that smRNAs evolved with multicellularity, expanding our perspective of these ancient regulatory pathways.",2016

Methods: Mammograms containing subtle malignant non-calcification lesions and simulated malignant calcification clusters were adapted to appear as if acquired by four types of detector. Observers searched for suspicious lesions and gave these a malignancy score. Analysis was undertaken using jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristics weighted figure of merit (FoM). Images of a CDMAM contrast-detail phantom were adapted to appear as if acquired using the same four detectors as the clinical images. The resultant threshold gold thicknesses were compared to the FoMs using a linear regression model and an F-test was used to find if the gradient of the relationship was significantly non-zero. Results: The detectors with the best image quality measurement also had the highest FoM values. The gradient of the inverse relationship between FoMs and threshold gold thickness for the 0.25mm diameter disk was significantly different from zero for calcification clusters (p=0.027), but not for non-calcification lesions (p=0.11). Systems performing just above the minimum image quality level set in the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis resulted in reduced cancer detection rates compared to systems performing at the achievable level. Conclusions: The clinical effectiveness of mammography for the task of detecting calcification clusters was found to be linked to image quality assessment using the CDMAM phantom. The European Guidelines should be reviewed as the current minimum image quality standards may be too low.",2016 Apr

However, FC metastasis to the kidney with eggshell calcification, as observed in the present case, is rare. The current report presents a case of a 67-year-old woman exhibiting a solitary tumor in the mid pole of the left kidney. Radical nephrectomy was performed, as the tumor was diagnosed as a primary renal carcinoma using contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Once the tumor was confirmed to be FC, total thyroidectomy was performed. Following administration of an oral therapeutic dose of 100 mCi 131I, functional imaging demonstrated the presence of multifocal metastases in the chest and abdomen. Euthyrox® was prescribed orally to aid normal thyroid function. Follow-up 6 months later using radionuclide imaging demonstrated the disappearance of the multifocal metastases in the chest and abdomen. The distant metastasis of FC may represent the initial symptom of the primary lesion, which was neglected. Ultrasound is an effective method to examine nodules located on the thyroid.",2016 May

CTA scans were acquired from a patient about to undergo the first minimally-invasive native TMVR procedure at the Gates Vascular Institute in Buffalo, NY. A python scripting library, the Vascular Modeling Toolkit (VMTK), was used to segment the 3D geometry of the patient’s cardiac chambers and mitral valve with severe stenosis, calcific in nature. A stereolithographic (STL) mesh was generated and AutoDesk Meshmixer was used to transform the vascular surface into a functioning closed flow loop. A Stratasys Objet 500 Connex3 multi-material printer was used to fabricate the phantom with distinguishable material features of the vasculature and calcified valve. The interventional team performed a mock procedure on the phantom, embedding valve cages in the model and imaging the phantom with a Toshiba Infinix INFX-8000V 5-axis C-arm bi-Plane angiography system.Results: After performing the mock-procedure on the cardiac phantom, the cardiologists optimized their transapical surgical approach. The mitral valve stenosis and calcification were clearly visible. The phantom was used to inform the sizing of the valve to be implanted. Conclusion: With advances in image processing and 3D printing technology, it is possible to create realistic patient-specific phantoms which can act as a guide for the interventional team. Using 3D printed phantoms as a valve sizing method shows potential as a more informative technique than typical CTA reconstruction alone.",2016 Feb 27

Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 162 patients who underwent BSGI in BI-RADS 4 lesions on mammography and/or ultrasound. Results: Of the 162 breast lesions, 66 were malignant tumors and 96 were benign tumors. Sensitivity and specificity of BSGI were 90.9% and 78.1%, and positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 74.1% and 92.6%. The sensitivity or specificity of mammography and ultrasound were 74.2% and 56.3% and 87.9% and 19.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of BSGI for breast lesions ≤1 cm were 88.0% and 86.8%, while the values of beast lesions >1 cm were 92.7% and 61.5%. The sensitivity or specificity of BSGI and mammography for patients with dense breasts were 92.0% and 81.3% and 72.0% and 50.0%, respectively. 26 patients showed neither a nodule nor microcalcification on ultrasound, but showed suspicious calcification on mammography. The sensitivity and specificity of BSGI with microcalcification only lesion were 75.0% and 94.4%. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that BSGI had shown high sensitivity and specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive values in BI-RADS 4 lesions on ultrasound and/or mammography. BSGI showed excellent results in dense breasts, in lesions that are less than 1 cm in size and lesions with suspicious microcalcification only.",2016 Apr
553,"Neyra J,Hu M",αKlotho and Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Alpha-Klotho (αKlotho) protein is encoded by the gene, Klotho, and functions as a coreceptor for endocrine fibroblast growth factor-23. The extracellular domain of αKlotho is cleaved by secretases and released into the circulation where it is called soluble αKlotho. Soluble αKlotho in the circulation starts to decline in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 2 and urinary αKlotho in even earlier CKD stage 1. Therefore soluble αKlotho is an early and sensitive marker of decline in kidney function. Preclinical data from numerous animal experiments support αKlotho deficiency as a pathogenic factor for CKD progression and extrarenal CKD complications including cardiac and vascular disease, hyperparathyroidism, and disturbed mineral metabolism. αKlotho deficiency induces cell senescence and renders cells susceptible to apoptosis induced by a variety of cellular insults including oxidative stress. αKlotho deficiency also leads to defective autophagy and angiogenesis and promotes fibrosis in the kidney and heart. Most importantly, prevention of αKlotho decline, upregulation of endogenous αKlotho production, or direct supplementation of soluble αKlotho are all associated with attenuation of renal fibrosis, retardation of CKD progression, improvement of mineral metabolism, amelioration of cardiac function and morphometry, and alleviation of vascular calcification in CKD. Therefore in rodents, αKlotho is not only a diagnostic and prognostic marker for CKD but the enhancement of endogenous or supplement of exogenous αKlotho are promising therapeutic strategies to prevent, retard, and decrease the comorbidity burden of CKD.",2016
554,"Azari-Yam A,Abrishami M",Apocrine mixed tumor of the eyelid: a case report.,"Background: Apocrine mixed tumor is usually found in parotid glands. Its cutaneous counterpart is rare and its occurrence in the eyelids is even rarer. Case presentation: This study reports an apocrine mixed tumor of the upper left eyelid in a 68 year-old lady with a history of breast cancer. This mass appeared about 3 years ago, as a slowly growing small nodule, and was completely excised. On microscopic examination, an encapsulated mass with epithelial and mesenchymal features was seen. The epithelial component presented tubular, cystic and infundibular structures while the mesenchymal component was fibrous in some areas and myxoid in others. Plasmacytoid hyaline cells, lipomatous change and focal calcification were appreciated focally. Immunohistochemical studies showed stromal staining for CD10, S-100, α-SMA and p63. Luminal cell layer of the epithelial component was positive for EMA, CK-7 and GCDFP-15 markers. The capsule was unbreached and no satellite lesions were appreciated. No evidence of relapse was evident after 16 months of follow-up. Conclusions: The diagnosis of eyelid tumors of adnexal origin can be challenging because they are rare and display a wide range of morphological patterns, as the tumor cells might differentiate along any line of the folliculosebaceous-apocrine system. Immunohistochemistry helps improve the accuracy of assessment.",2016

Due to the epithelial-growth pattern with geographic necrosis exhibited by the neoplastic cells, ETT is commonly confused, both clinically and pathologically, with squamous cell carcinoma. Although there have been no previous reports of ETT focusing on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, we report a case of uterine ETT with special attention to the MRI findings referring to the pathological findings and MR images of previous reports. A 42-year-old Japanese woman (gravid 1, para 1) presented with uterus enlargement during screening, and complained of recent-onset lower abdominal pain. The MRI showed a solid tumor throughout the entire myometrium of the lower uterine segment, with the hemorrhagic cystic portion extending to the posterior subserosal space. Following hysterectomy, the final pathological diagnosis was ETT. An ETT is essentially a solid tumor composed of intermediate trophoblasts that exhibit an epithelial-like growth pattern and contain geographic necrosis with calcification. In our case, MRI revealed a non-specific-intensity solid tumor in the lower uterine segment with massive necrosis and hemorrhage extending to the subserosa. While it is difficult to distinguish between ETT and uterine carcinomas, recognition of certain tumor shapes and necrosis could enable more accurate diagnosis before treatment.",2016
556,"Duan SB,Yu J,Li X,Han ZY,Zhai HY,Liang P",Diagnostic value of two-dimensional shear wave elastography in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictability of two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) for papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). Materials and methods: One hundred and eighteen patients with 137 thyroid nodules (46 benign nodules, 91 malignant nodules) were included in this study who received conventional ultrasound (US) and 2D-SWE before fine-needle aspiration or surgery. The diagnostic performance was compared between US findings only and the combined use of US findings with 2D-SWE, which were correlated with pathology results. Results: Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic performance of 2D-SWE. Conventional US findings and 2D-SWE values were analyzed and compared between benign and malignant thyroid nodules. The mean values of SWE_mean, SWE_min, and SWE_max were 46.6±16.7, 26.2±9.5, and 73.6±18.1 kPa, respectively, in PTMC, which were significantly higher than those in benign tumors (27.8±12.4, 15.8±8.6, and 50.3±22.6 kPa, P<0.001). The optimal cut-off values of SWE_mean, SWE_min, and SWE_max for predicting malignancy were 34.5, 21.8, and 53.2 kPa, respectively. Taller than wide, micro-calcification, and SWE_mean were found to be independent risk factors for predicting PTMC. The overall sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of combined conventional US features with 2D-SWE parameters were 95.7%, 94.5%, 94.9%, 89.8%, and 97.7%, respectively; these were superior to those of conventional US (89.1%, 90.1%, 89.9%, 82.0%, and 93.2%). Conclusion: The study indicates that the quantitative parameters of 2D-SWE are an independent predictive factor for diagnosing PTMC, which could provide valuable information when conventional US cannot give determinate results.",2016

However, how miR-135a is involved in the calcification in senescent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is not clear yet. In the present study, we first identified the significantly altered miRNAs in VSMCs, then performed consecutive passage culture of VSMCs and analyzed the expression of miR-135a and calcification genes in the senescent phase. Next, the effects of the miR-135a inhibition on calcification and calcification genes were analyzed. The luciferase assay was used to validate the target protein of miR-135a. The western blotting was used to determine the effects of miR-135a on Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 protein (STAT3) expression, as well as the relationship between KLF4 and STAT3. Finally, the quantified cellular calcification was measured to examine the involvement of miR-135a, KLF4 and STAT3 in VSMCs calcification. Our results showed that miR-135a was significantly altered in VSMCs. Cell calcification and calcification genes were greatly altered by miR-135a inhibition. KLF4 was validated as the target RNA of miR-135a. Expression of KLF4 and STAT3 were both significantly decreased by over expressed miR-135a, while the inhibition of miR-135a and KLF4 siRNA both decreased the STAT3 protein levels. Moreover, the inhibition of miR-135a dramatically increased the calcium concentration, but co-treatment with KLF4 or STAT3 siRNA both decreased the calcium concentration. The present study identified miR-135a as a potential osteogenic differentiation suppressor in senescent VSMCs and revealed that KLF4/STAT3 pathway, at least partially, was involved in the mechanism.",2016 Mar

Materials and Methods:: Three hundred and sixty-five patients with clinically suspected thyroid lesions during the period from November 1, 2011, to August 31, 2015, were prospectively scanned on gray-scale and Doppler imaging by six radiologists separately. We used GE VOLUSON 730 PRO machine (GE healthcare, Milwaukee, USA) equipped with a 7.5–12 MHz high-frequency linear array transducer with color and power Doppler capability. We evaluated five sonological features: Internal composition, echogenicity, margins, presence and type of calcification, and shape of the lesion. Based on the TIRADS proposed by Kwak et al., we determined categories of the thyroid lesions. The diagnostic performance of TIRADS classification system was evaluated by comparison with the fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) reports which were subsequently obtained after taking informed consent from the patients. All follicular neoplasms on FNAC were further followed up with excision biopsy and histology. The cytopathological report was used as the standard final diagnosis for comparison. The P value and odds ratio were determined to quantify how strongly the presence or absence of a particular ultrasound feature was associated with benignity or malignancy in the study population. The risk of malignancy was stratified for each TIRADS category-based on the total number of benign and malignant lesions in that category. Cervical lymph nodes were also evaluated for their size, loss of the central, echogenic hilum, presence of irregular and indistinct margin, microcalcification, and necrotic changes. Cohen's Kappa coefficient was determined separately for each of the five TIRADS malignant features to study the inter-observer agreement. Furthermore, the percentage of benign cases that were accurately determined by TIRADS which could have avoided unnecessary FNAC was determined. Results:: The risk of malignancy in TIRADS categories 1 and 2 was found to be 0%, 0.64% in category 3, 4.76% in category 4A, 66.67% in category 4B, 83.33% in category 4C, and 100% in category 5. Out of the five suspicious sonological features, irregular margins showed the highest positive predictive value (95.45%) for malignancy followed by taller than wide shape (92.86%), microcalcifications (66.67%), marked hypoechogenicity (54.55%), and solid composition (48.15%). The specificity of three sonological features (completely cystic structure, hyperechogenicity, and macrocalcification) in classifying a nodule as benign was 100%. Loss of central echogenic hilum, presence of an irregular and indistinct margin, microcalcification and necrosis were found to have sensitivity of 100%, 63.63%, 27.27%, and 9.09%, respectively and specificity of 95.7%, 98.5%, 100%, and 100%, respectively for cervical lymph node to be malignant. The Kappa value for taller than wide shape, microcalcification, marked hypoechogenicity, solid composition, and irregular margins was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1–1), 1.0 (95% CI: 1–1), 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82–1), 0.88 (95% CI: 0.77–0.92), and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.64–1), respectively. The estimated decrease in unnecessary FNACs was found to be 43.83–86.30%. Conclusions:: TIRADS proposed by Kwak et al., combined with evaluation for sonological features of malignant lymph nodes is a valuable, safe, widely available, and easily reproducible imaging tool to stratify the risk of a thyroid lesion and helps in precluding unnecessary FNACs in a significant number of patients. TIRADS features convincingly show comparable results in the interpretation of TIRADS features more so, in the hands of radiologists experienced in thyroid imaging.",2016
559,"Si L,Zhai R,Liu X,Yang K,Wang L,Jiang T",MRI in the differential diagnosis of primary architectural distortion detected by mammography.,"PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a combination of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in lesions that manifest with architectural distortion (AD) on mammography. METHODS: All full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images obtained between August 2010 and January 2013 were reviewed retrospectively, and 57 lesions showing AD were included in the study. Two independent radiologists reviewed all mammograms and MRI data and recorded lesion characteristics according to the BI-RADS lexicon. The gold standard was histopathologic results from biopsies or surgical excisions and results of the two-year follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was carried out to define the most effective threshold ADC value to differentiate malignant from benign breast lesions. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of FFDM, DCE-MRI, FFDM+DCE-MRI, and DCE-MRI+ADC. RESULTS: Of the 57 lesions analyzed, 28 were malignant and 29 were benign. The most effective threshold for the normalized ADC (nADC) was 0.61 with 93.1% sensitivity and 75.0% specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of DCE-MRI combined with nADC was 92.9% and 79.3%, respectively. DCE-MRI combined with nADC showed the highest specificity and equal sensitivity compared with other modalities, independent of the presentation of calcification. CONCLUSION: DCE-MRI combined with nADC values was more reliable than mammography in differentiating the nature of disease manifesting as primary AD on mammography.",2016 Mar

Methods: The mRNA levels and protein levels of HIF-1α and HIF-2α were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot separately in 30 pairs of PTCs and normal thyroid cases. The protein levels were also detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using 92 samples of PTC group and 46 normal samples as control group for analyzing the biological and clinical significance of the expression of HIF-1α/HIF-2α. Results: Real-time PCR results showed the mRNA level of HIF-1α and HIF-2α were significantly higher in PTC than normal group (P < 0.001). Also, significantly higher positive rates (73 %/65 %) of HIF-1α and HIF-2α were observed in PTC compared with the control group (27 %/35 %) by IHC (P < 0.01); the consistent results were gotten with Western blot. Although we did not find a significant correlation between the expression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α with gender, age, calcification, or Hashimoto’s disease in the present study (P > 0.05), both of their expressions were correlated to lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05), capsular invasion (P < 0.05), and TNM stage (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Overexpression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α are associated with the carcinogenesis of PTC, served as potential biomarkers of PTC.",2016
561,"Heuts S,Maessen JG,Sardari Nia P",Preoperative planning of left-sided valve surgery with 3D computed tomography reconstruction models: sternotomy or a minimally invasive approach?†.,"OBJECTIVES: With the emergence of a new concept aimed at individualization of patient care, the focus will shift from whether a minimally invasive procedure is better than conventional treatment, to the question of which patients will benefit most from which technique? The superiority of minimally invasive valve surgery (MIVS) has not yet been proved. We believe that through better patient selection advantages of this technique can become more pronounced. In our current study, we evaluate the feasibility of 3D computed tomography (CT) imaging reconstruction in the preoperative planning of patients referred for MIVS. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all consecutive patients who were referred for minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS) and minimally invasive aortic valve replacement (MIAVR) to a single surgeon in a tertiary referral centre for MIVS between March 2014 and 2015. Prospective preoperative planning was done for all patients and was based on evaluations by a multidisciplinary heart-team, an echocardiography, conventional CT images and 3D CT reconstruction models. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients were included in our study; 16 for mitral valve surgery (MVS) and 23 patients for aortic valve replacement (AVR). Eleven patients (69%) within the MVS group underwent MIMVS. Five patients (31%) underwent conventional MVS. Findings leading to exclusion for MIMVS were a tortuous or slender femoro-iliac tract, calcification of the aortic bifurcation, aortic elongation and pericardial calcifications. Furthermore, 2 patients had a change of operative strategy based on preoperative planning. Seventeen (74%) patients in the AVR group underwent MIAVR. Six patients (26%) underwent conventional AVR. Indications for conventional AVR instead of MIAVR were an elongated ascending aorta, ascending aortic calcification and ascending aortic dilatation. One patient (6%) in the MIAVR group was converted to a sternotomy due to excessive intraoperative bleeding. Two mortalities were reported during conventional MVS. There were no mortalities reported in the MIMVS, MIAVR or conventional AVR group. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative planning of minimally invasive left-sided valve surgery with 3D CT reconstruction models is a useful and feasible method to determine operative strategy and exclude patients ineligible for a minimally invasive approach, thus potentially preventing complications.",2016 May

Cardiovascular risk (CVR) was used to divide these patients in three categories: Low (LR), medium (MR) and high risk (HR). 18F-NaF uptake was measured by manually drawing volumes of interest on the ascending aorta, on the aortic arch, on the descending aorta and on the myocardium; average standardized uptake value was normalized for blood-pool, to obtain target-to-background ratio (TBR). Values from the three aortic segments were then averaged to obtain an index of the whole thoracic aorta.RESULTS: A significant difference in whole thoracic aorta TBR was detected between HR and LR (1.84 ± 0.76 vs 1.07 ± 0.3, P < 0.001), but also between MR and HR-LR (1.4 ± 0.4, P < 0.02 and P < 0.01, respectively). Significance of this TBR stratification strongly varied among thoracic aorta subsegments and the lowest P values were reached in the descending aorta (P < 0.01). Myocardial uptake provided an effective CVR classes stratification (P < 0.001).Correlation between TBR and CVR was appreciable when the whole thoracic aorta was considered (R = 0.67), but it peaked when correlating the descending thoracic segment (R = 0.75), in comparison with the aortic arch and the ascending segment (R = 0.55 and 0.53, respectively).CONCLUSION: Fluoride uptake within the thoracic aorta wall effectively depicts patients’ risk class and correlates with cardiovascular risk. Descending aorta is the most effective in CVR determination.",2016 Jan 28

564,"Han KH,O'Neill WC",Increased Peripheral Arterial Calcification in Patients Receiving Warfarin.,"Background: Matrix Gla protein is a vitamin K–dependent inhibitor of vascular calcification. Warfarin use is associated with increased breast arterial calcification, but whether this is reflective of other arteries or occurs in men is unclear. In this study, the prevalence of calcification in peripheral arteries was compared in patients with and without warfarin therapy. Methods and Results: This retrospective matched cohort study assessed 430 patients with radiographs performed during or after warfarin therapy who were identified by a computerized search of medical records. Each patient was matched to a patient without warfarin exposure based on age, sex, and diabetes status. Patients with warfarin exposure <1 month, history of end‐stage renal disease, or serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dl were excluded. Radiographs were reviewed visually for arterial calcification. The prevalence of arterial calcification was 44% greater in patients with versus without warfarin use (30.2% versus 20.9%, P=0.0023) but not on radiographs performed before warfarin therapy (26.4% versus 22.4%, n=156) or prior to 5 years of warfarin therapy. The increase was noted only in the ankle and foot, was limited to a medial pattern of calcification, and was similar in men and women. Conclusions: Warfarin use is associated with lower extremity arterial calcification in both men and women independent of age, sex, diabetes status, and other patient characteristics. This may have implications for the choice of therapies for long‐term anticoagulation.",2016 Jan

We designed this 12-month, prospective, multicenter, open–label, randomized study to evaluate whether subtotal parathyroidectomy is more effective than cinacalcet for controlling hypercalcemia caused by persistent hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplant. Kidney allograft recipients with hypercalcemia and elevated intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) concentration were eligible if they had received a transplant ≥6 months before the study and had an eGFR>30 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with normocalcemia at 12 months. Secondary end points were serum iPTH concentration, serum phosphate concentration, bone mineral density, vascular calcification, renal function, patient and graft survival, and economic cost. In total, 30 patients were randomized to receive cinacalcet (n=15) or subtotal parathyroidectomy (n=15). At 12 months, ten of 15 patients in the cinacalcet group and 15 of 15 patients in the parathyroidectomy group (P=0.04) achieved normocalcemia. Normalization of serum phosphate concentration occurred in almost all patients. Subtotal parathyroidectomy induced greater reduction of iPTH and associated with a significant increase in femoral neck bone mineral density; vascular calcification remained unchanged in both groups. The most frequent adverse events were digestive intolerance in the cinacalcet group and hypocalcemia in the parathyroidectomy group. Surgery would be more cost effective than cinacalcet if cinacalcet duration reached 14 months. All patients were alive with a functioning graft at the end of follow-up. In conclusion, subtotal parathyroidectomy was superior to cinacalcet in controlling hypercalcemia in these patients with kidney transplants and persistent hyperparathyroidism.",2016 Aug

Materials and Methods: From March 2013 to October 2014, 114 women (age range, 29–76 years; mean age, 50.0 years) underwent Wi-UVAB using a 13-gauge needle (Mammotome Elite®; Devicor Medical Products, Cincinnati, OH, USA). In 103 lesions of 96 women with surgical (n = 81) or follow-up (n = 22) data, complications, biopsy procedure, imaging findings of biopsy targets and histologic results were reviewed. Results: Mean number of biopsy cores was 10 (range 4–25). Nine patients developed moderate bleeding. All lesions were suspicious on US, and included non-mass lesions (67.0%) and mass lesions (33.0%). Visible calcifications on US were evident in 57.3% of the target lesions. Most of the lesions (93.2%) were nonpalpable. Sixty-six (64.1%) were malignant [ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) rate, 61%] and 12 were high-risk lesions (11.7%). Histologic underestimation was identified in 11 of 40 (27.5%). DCIS cases and in 3 of 9 (33.3%) high-risk lesions necessitating surgery. There was no false-negative case. Conclusion: Wi-UVAB is very handy and advantageous for US-unapparent non-mass lesions to diagnose DCIS, especially for calcification cases. Histologic underestimation is unavoidable; still, Wi-UVAB is safe and accurate to diagnose a malignancy.",2015
569,"Suhail Z,Sarwar M,Murtaza K",Automatic detection of abnormalities in mammograms.,"Background: In recent years, an increased interest has been seen in the area of medical image processing and, as a consequence, Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) systems. The basic purpose of CAD systems is to assist doctors in the process of diagnosis. CAD systems, however, are quite expensive, especially, in most of the developing countries. Our focus is on developing a low-cost CAD system. Today, most of the CAD systems regarding mammogram classification target automatic detection of calcification and abnormal mass. Calcification normally indicates an early symptom of breast cancer if it appears as a small size bright spot in a mammogram image. Methods: Based on the observation that calcification appears as small bright spots on a mammogram image, we propose a new scale-specific blob detection technique in which the scale is selected through supervised learning. By computing energy for each pixel at two different scales, a new feature “Ratio Energy” is introduced for efficient blob detection. Due to the imposed simplicity of the feature and post processing, the running time of our algorithm is linear with respect to image size. Results: Two major types of calcification, microcalcification and macrocalcification have been identified and highlighted by drawing a circular boundary outside the area that contains calcification. Results are quite visible and satisfactory, and the radiologists can easily view results through the final detected boundary. Conclusions: CAD systems are designed to help radiologists in verifying their diagnostics. A new way of identifying calcification is proposed based on the property that microcalcification is small in size and appears in clusters. Results are quite visible and encouraging, and can assist radiologists in early detection of breast cancer.",2015
570,"Park PY,Goldin T,Chang J,Markman M,Kundranda MN",Signet-Ring Cell Carcinoma of the Colon: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"Background: Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) is the third leading cause of death in the United States. One of the histologic subtypes of CRC is signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC), which has a distinct molecular and tumor biology from that of adenocarcinoma. Primary SRCC diagnosed at an early stage is very rare as most cases are detected at an advanced stage. Therefore, overall prognosis of SRCC is poor. Case Presentation: A 36-year-old female presented to her primary care physician with new-onset progressive right lower quadrant pain without any significant past medical or family history. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed a 4.9 × 3.5 × 3.1 cm, lobulated, septated cystic mass arising from the cecum. The mass demonstrated wall enhancement and contained focal areas of coarse calcification. There was nodal involvement either locally or distally. The patient underwent right hemicolectomy, and pathology revealed a high-grade mucinous carcinoma with signet-ring cell variant invading through the muscularis propria and into the subserosal adipose tissue. The margins were negative for tumor, and no lymphovascular or perineural invasion was noted. None of the 14 resected pericolonic lymph nodes was positive for malignancy. Hence, she was staged as pT3, pN0, pMx-stage IIA. The appendix was not involved. Microsatellite instability testing showed the preservation of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 proteins by IHC and PCR. Carcinoembryonic antigen level was within normal limits. Due to the patient's young age, aggressive histology and microsatellite-stable status, adjuvant fluropyrimidine (5-FU)-based therapy with the single agent capecitabine was initiated. The patient completed 6 months of adjuvant therapy and has been disease free for approximately 18 months. Conclusion: Primary SRCC of the cecum is a rare disease. Given the poor prognosis of these patients, early-stage disease with microsatellite-stable patients should be considered for adjuvant 5-FU-based therapy in an attempt to prevent recurrence.",2015 Sep-Dec
571,"Wong TY,Wu CY,Martel J,Lin CW,Hsu FY,Ojcius DM,Lin PY,Young JD",Detection and characterization of mineralo-organic nanoparticles in human kidneys.,"Ectopic calcification is associated with various human diseases, including atherosclerosis, cancer, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. Although mineral nanoparticles have been detected in calcified blood vessels, the nature and role of these particles in the human body remain unclear. Here we show for the first time that human kidney tissues obtained from end-stage chronic kidney disease or renal cancer patients contain round, multilamellar mineral particles of 50 to 1,500 nm, whereas no particles are observed in healthy controls. The mineral particles are found mainly in the extracellular matrix surrounding the convoluted tubules, collecting ducts and loops of Henle as well as within the cytoplasm of tubule-delineating cells, and consist of polycrystalline calcium phosphate similar to the mineral found in bones and ectopic calcifications. The kidney mineral nanoparticles contain several serum proteins that inhibit ectopic calcification in body fluids, including albumin, fetuin-A, and apolipoprotein A1. Since the mineralo-organic nanoparticles are found not only within calcified deposits but also in areas devoid of microscopic calcifications, our observations indicate that the nanoparticles may represent precursors of calcification and renal stones in humans.",2015

Supplementary dietary cholecalciferol (25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25-OH), the precursor of calcitriol, is commonly employed to combat this problem; however, dosage must be carefully determined as excess dietary vitamin D can cause toxicity resulting in a decrease in bone calcification, hypercalcinemia and renal failure. Despite much research on the therapeutic administration of dietary vitamin D in humans, the relative sensitivity of avian species to exogenous vitamin D has not been well defined. In order to determine the effects of exogenous 1,25-(OH)2D3 during avian osteogenesis, chicken bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) were exposed to varying doses of 1,25-(OH)2D3 during in vitro osteogenic differentiation and examined for markers of early proliferation and osteogenic induction. Similar to humans and other mammals, poultry BM-MSCs were found to be highly sensitive to exogenous 1,25-(OH)2D3 with super pharmacological levels exerting significant inhibition of mineralization and loss of cell proliferation in vitro. Strain related differences were apparent, with BM-MCSs derived from layers strains showing a higher level of sensitivity to 1,25-(OH)2D3 than those from broilers. These data suggest that understanding species and strain specific sensitivities to 1,25-(OH)2D3 is important for optimizing bone health in the poultry industry and that use of avian BM-MSCs are a useful tool for examining underlying effects of genetic variation in poultry.",2015 Nov
573,"Cheung YC,Juan YH,Ueng SH,Lo YF,Huang PC,Lin YC,Chen SC",Assessment of Breast Specimens With or Without Calcifications in Diagnosing Malignant and Atypia for Mammographic Breast Microcalcifications Without Mass: A STARD-Compliant Diagnostic Accuracy Article.,"Presence of microcalcifications within the specimens frequently signifies a successful attempt of stereotactic vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB) in obtaining a pathologic diagnosis of the breast microcalcifications. In this study, the authors aimed to assess and compare the accuracy and consistency of calcified or noncalcified specimens obtained from same sites of sampling on isolated microcalcifications without mass in diagnosing high-risk and malignant lesions. To the best of our knowledge, an individual case-based prospective comparison has not been reported.With the approval from institutional review board of our hospital (Chang Gung Memorial Hospital), the authors retrospectively reviewed all clinical cases of stereotactic VABBs on isolated breast microcalcifications without mass from our database. The authors included those having either surgery performed or had clinical follow-up of at least 3 years for analysis. All the obtained specimens with or without calcification were identified using specimen radiographs and separately submitted for pathologic evaluation. The concordance of diagnosis was assessed for both atypia and malignant lesions.A total of 390 stereotactic VABB procedures (1206 calcified and 1456 noncalcified specimens) were collected and reviewed. The consistent rates between calcified and noncalcified specimens were low for atypia and malignant microcalcifications (44.44% in flat epithelial atypia, 46.51% in atypical ductal hyperplasia, 55.73% in ductal carcinoma in situ, and 71.42% in invasive ductal carcinoma). The discordance in VABB diagnoses indicated that 41.33% of malignant lesions would be misdiagnosed by noncalcified specimens. Furthermore, calcified specimens showed higher diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer as compared with the noncalcified specimens (91.54 % versus 69.49%, respectively). The evaluation of both noncalcified specimens and calcified specimens did not show improvement of diagnostic accuracy as compared with evaluating calcified specimens alone (91.54% versus 91.54%, respectively).The high prevalence of diagnostic discordance between the calcified and noncalcified specimens indicated the higher value of calcified specimens in diagnosing atypia and malignant microcalcifications. Noncalcified specimens did not provide additional diagnostic benefit from this study. The separation of calcified and noncalcified specimens may facilitate more focused interpretation from pathologists among the large number of specimens.",2015 Oct

METHODS: From 2000 to 2010, the records of 353 DCIS patients presenting with microcalcification-only lesions who underwent SVAB were retrospectively reviewed. The mammographic size of microcalcification cluster, presence of microinvasion within the cores, the total number of calcium specks, and the number of calcium specks within the retrieved core biopsy specimen were recorded. Patients were grouped as those with or without invasion in the final pathologic report, and variables were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The median age was 58 years (range, 34–88 years). At histopathologic examination of the surgical specimen, 63 of 353 patients (17.8%) were found to have an invasive component, although SVAB cores had only shown DCIS preoperatively. The rate of underestimation was significantly higher in patients with microcalcification covering an area of 40 mm or more, in the presence of microinvasion at biopsy, and in cases where less than 40% of the calcium specks were removed from the lesion. CONCLUSION: Invasion might be underestimated in DCIS cases diagnosed with SVAB performed for microcalcification-only lesions, especially when the mammographic size of calcification is equal to or more than 40 mm or if microinvasion is found within the biopsy specimen and less than 40% of the calcifications are removed. At least 40% of microcalcification specks should be removed from the lesion to decrease the rate of underestimation with SVAB.",2016 Jan
575,"Ressl N,Oberndorfer S",Multiple calcified brain metastases in a man with invasive ductal breast cancer.,"We report a case of a 52-year-old Caucasian man with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. One year after initial diagnosis, he developed a generalised epileptic seizure and neuroimaging showed multiple, calcified intracerebral lesions. Owing to these atypical cerebral imaging findings, comprehensive serological and cerebrospinal fluid analysis was conducted and a latent toxoplasmosis was suspected. In order to distinguish between metastases and an infectious disease, a cerebral biopsy was performed, which verified brain metastases. The patient received whole-brain radiotherapy. The last cerebral CT scan, 18 months later showed stable disease. Calcification of brain metastases in patients with breast cancer is very rare. Owing to their non-characteristic radiological appearance with a lack of contrast enhancement, diagnosis of metastases can be difficult. Infectious diseases should be considered within the diagnostic work up. Owing to possible pitfalls, we recommend a widespread differential diagnostic work up in similar cases, and even in cases with a confirmed primary tumour.",2015
576,"Zheng Y,Xu B,Zhao Y,Gu H,Li C,Wang Y,Chang X",CA1 contributes to microcalcification and tumourigenesis in breast cancer.,"Background: Although mammary microcalcification is frequently observed and has been associated with poor survival in patients with breast cancer, the genesis of calcification remains unclear. Carbonic anhydrase I (CA1) has been shown to promote calcification by catalysing the hydration of CO2. This study aimed to determine whether CA1 was correlated with microcalcification and with other processes that are involved in breast cancer tumourigenesis. Methods: CA1 expression in breast cancer tissues and blood samples was detected using western blotting, real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Calcification was induced in the cultured 4T1 cell line originating from mouse breast tumours, using ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate. Acetazolamide, a chemical inhibitor of CA1, was also added to the culture to determine the role of CA1 in calcification. The MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line was treated with anti-CA1 siRNA and was assessed using a CCK-8 cell proliferation assay, an annexin V cell apoptosis assay, transwell migration assay and a human breast cancer PCR array. The tag SNP rs725605, which is located in the CA1 locus, was genotyped using TaqMan® genotyping. Results: Increased CA1 expression was detected in samples of breast carcinoma tissues and blood obtained from patients with breast cancer. A total of 15.3 % of these blood samples exhibited a 2.1-fold or higher level of CA1 expression, compared to the average level of CA1 expression in samples from healthy controls. Following the induction of calcification of 4T1 cells, both the number of calcium-rich deposits and the expression of CA1 increased, whereas the calcification and CA1 expression were significantly supressed in the presence of acetazolamide. Increased migration and apoptosis were observed in MCF-7 cells that were treated with anti-CA1 siRNA. The PCR array detected up-regulation of the androgen receptor (AR) and down-regulation of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) in the treated MCF-7 cells. Significant differences in the allele and genotype frequencies of rs725605 were detected in the cohort of patients with breast cancer but not in other tumours. Conclusion: The results of this study suggested that CA1 is a potential oncogene and that it contributes to abnormal cell calcification, apoptosis and migration in breast cancer.

Methods:: A retrospective review of 177 females before and after an AWB-RT treatment (follow-up ranging from 5 to 9 years) was performed by four radiologists focused in breast imaging who independently evaluated diffuse mammographic density patterns and reported on possible onset of focal alterations; modifications in density and fibrosis with parenchymal distortion were deemed as indicators of AWB-RT treatment impact in breast imaging. Results:: Prevalent mammographic density (D) patterns in the 177 females evaluated were according to the American College of Radiology–Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR-BIRADS): D1, fibroadipose density (score percentage from 55.9% to 43.5%); and D2, scattered fibroglandular density (from 42.9% to 32.7%). No change in diffuse mammographic density and no significant difference in mammographic breast parenchymal structure were observed. “No change” was reported with score percentage from 87% to 79.6%. Appearance of fibrosis with parenchymal distortion was reported by all radiologists in only two cases (1.1%, p = 0.3); dystrophic calcification was identified with percentage score from 2.2% to 3.3% (small type) and from 9.6% to 12.9% (coarse type). Conclusion:: No statistically significant changes in follow-up mammographies 5–9 years after AWB-RT were detected, justifying large-scale selection of AWB-RT treatment with no risk of altering radiological breast parameters of common use in tumour recurrence detection. Advances in knowledge:: The hypofractionated radiotherapy (AWB-RT treatment) is a new proven, safe and effective modality in post-operative patients with early breast cancer with excellent local control and survival. In our study, the absence of changes in mammographic density patterns and in breast imaging before and after AWB-RT treatment (up to 5–9 years after radiotherapy) justifies large-scale use of AWB-RT treatment without hindrance in tumour recurrence diagnosis.",2015 Nov

Systemic treatments of MMP inhibitors have shown effectiveness in animal models but it did not translate to clinical success either due low doses used or systemic side-effects of MMP inhibitors. We propose a targeted nanoparticle based delivery of MMP inhibitor at very low doses to the AAA site. Such therapy will be an attractive option for preventing expansion of aneurysms in patients without systemic side effects. Objective: Our previous study showed that poly D, L-lactide (PLA) nanoparticles (NPs) conjugated with an anti-elastin antibody could be targeted to the site of an aneurysm in a rat model of AAA. In the study reported here, we tested whether such targeted NPs could deliver the MMP inhibitor batimastat (BB-94) to the site of an aneurysm and prevent aneurysmal growth. Methods and Results: PLA NPs were loaded with BB-94 and conjugated with an elastin antibody. Intravenous injections of elastin antibody-conjugated BB-94-loaded NPs (EL-NP-BB94) targeted the site of aneurysms and delivered BB-94 in a calcium chloride injury-induced AAA in rats. Such targeted delivery inhibited MMP activity, elastin degradation, calcification, and aneurysmal development in the aorta (269% expansion in control vs. 40% EL-NP-BB94) at a low dose of BB-94. The systemic administration of BB-94 alone at the same dose was ineffective in producing MMP inhibition. Conclusions: Targeted delivery of MMP inhibitors using NPs may be an attractive strategy to inhibit aneurysmal progression.",2015 Nov 6

Materials and Methods: The study group comprised 47 consecutive BAC (+) women, whereas the control group comprised 33 BAC (−) women (total, 80 women). All mammograms were examined by a specialist without being any apartheid that it was come from central or not. For the exist and density of calcification was used classification method. When we evaluate carotid arterial plaque with Doppler US used scale method. For analyzing categorical variables, we used chi-square test, and for numeric variables, we used independent t-test. Results: As nearly all BAC+ women had all types of carotid plaques, weighted of them was found that they were fatty plaque type (n=13 %46.4). Only one BAC+ patient was grade 2 and had no carotid plaques (n=1 %3.6). MAK– patients had nearly no plaque types.

We hypothesized that sodium [18F]fluoride (Na[18F]F) PET could be used to detect microcalcifications in a chronically Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected murine model. Procedures: C3HeB/FeJ mice, which develop necrotic and hypoxic TB lesions, were aerosolinfected with M. tuberculosis and imaged with Na[18F]F PET. Results: Pulmonary TB lesions from chronically infected mice demonstrated significantly higher Na[18F]F uptake compared with acutely infected or uninfected animals (P<0.01), while no differences were noted in the blood or bone compartments (P>0.08). Ex vivo biodistribution studies confirmed the imaging findings, and tissue histology demonstrated microcalcifications in TB lesions from chronically infected mice, which has not been demonstrated previously in a murine model. Conclusion: Na[18F]F PET can be used for the detection of chronic TB lesions and could prove to be a useful noninvasive biomarker for TB studies.",2015 Oct

However, recent findings suggest that PC exerts its disease-modifying effect, at least in part, through a crystal-independent action. This study sought to examine the disease-modifying effects of PC and its analogue PC-β-ethyl ester (PC-E) on partial meniscectomy-induced OA and the structure-activity relationship. Methods: Calcification- and proliferation-inhibitory activities were examined in OA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) culture. Disease-modifying effects were examined using Hartley guinea pigs undergoing partial meniscectomy. Cartilage degeneration was examined with Indian ink, safranin-O, and picrosirius red. Levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5 (ADAMTS5), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5), and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) were examined with immunostaining. The effects of PC-E and PC on gene expressions in OA FLSs were examined with microarray. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation and analyzed using Student’s t test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: PC-E was slightly less powerful than PC as a calcification inhibitor but as powerful as PC in the inhibition of OA FLSs proliferation. PC significantly inhibited cartilage degeneration in the partial meniscectomied right knee. PC-E was less powerful than PC as a disease-modifying drug, especially in the inhibition of cartilage degeneration in the non-operated left knee. PC significantly reduced the levels of ADAMTS5, MMP-13 and CCL5, whereas PC-E reduced the levels of ADAMTS5 and CCL5. Microarray analyses revealed that PC-E failed to downregulate the expression of many PC-downregulated genes classified in angiogenesis and inflammatory response. Conclusions: PC is a disease-modifying drug for posttraumatic OA therapy. PC exerts its disease-modifying effect through two independent actions: inhibiting pathological calcification and modulating the expression of many genes implicated in OA. The β-carboxyl group of PC plays an important role in the inhibition of cartilage degeneration, little role in the inhibition of FLSs proliferation, and a moderate role in the inhibition of FLSs-mediated calcification.",2015

RET and ROS1 rearrangements are each found in 1–2% of lung adenocarcinomas and represent distinct molecular subsets. This study assessed the computed tomography (CT) imaging features of patients with RET- and ROS1-rearranged lung cancers. METHODS: Eligible patients included pathologically-confirmed lung adenocarcinomas of any stage with a RET or ROS1 rearrangement via fluorescence in-situ hybridization or next-generation sequencing, and available pre-treatment baseline imaging for review. A cohort of EGFR-mutant lung cancers was identified as a control group. CT features assessed included location, consistency, contour, presence of cavitation, and calcification of the primary tumor. Presence of an effusion, lung metastases, adenopathy and extrathoracic disease were recorded. The Wilcoxon rank-sum/Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare features between groups. RESULTS: 73 patients with lung adenocarcinomas were identified: 17 (23%) with ROS1 fusions, 25 (34%) with RET fusions and 31 (43%) with EGFR mutations. ROS1-rearranged lung cancers were more likely to present as peripheral tumors in comparison to EGFR-mutant lung cancers (32% vs 65%, p=0.04). RET-rearranged lung cancers did not significantly differ from EGFR-mutant lung cancers radiographically. The consistency of the primary lesion for RET and ROS fusions and EGFR mutations were most frequently solid and spiculated. CONCLUSIONS: Lung adenocarcinomas with RET and ROS1 fusions share many radiographic features and those with ROS1 fusion are more likely to present as peripheral lesions in comparison to EGFR-mutant lung cancers.",2015 Nov

Methods: Specimens of 46 breast cancer patients were imaged by using a prototype CBCT system. Each patient underwent mammography, CBCT and X-ray of breast surgical specimen within 6 months. Images of mammography, breast surgical specimen radiography and CBCT were evaluated by an experienced radiologist. Indicators, such as: morphology, glitch, density, invasion, structural distortion and calcification, were observed. Result: There was no significant difference of the calcification, glitch and morphology among three methods. However, there was significant difference in indicators of breast tumor invasion among three methods. There was statistical significance in detecting invasions of breast cancer cells in peripheral tissues among three methods. Conclusion: CBCT shows no superiority over mammography and specimen radiography in determining tumor’s outline and detecting calcification. On the other hand, CBCT demonstrates its advantage in determining the 3 dimensional position of a lesion which could be a potential clinical application in future practices of breast imaging.",2015

Methods: SuperSonic Imagine (SSI) and comb-push ultrasound shear elastography (CUSE) were performed on three sets of phantoms to investigate how calcifications of different sizes and distributions influence measured elasticity. To demonstrate the effect in vivo, three female patients with benign breast masses associated with mammographically-identified calcifications were evaluated by CUSE. Results: Apparent maximum elasticity (Emax) estimates resulting from individual macrocalcifications (with diameters of 2mm, 3mm, 5mm, 6mm, 9mm, 11mm, and 15mm) showed values over 50 kPa for all cases, which represents more than 100% increase over background (~21kPa). We considered a 2cm-diameter circular region of interest for all phantom experiments. Mean elasticity (Emean) values varied from 26 kPa to 73 kPa, depending on the macrocalcification size. Highly dense clusters of microcalcifications showed higher Emax values than clusters of microcalcification with low concentrations, but the difference in Emean values was not significant. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the presence of large isolated macrocalcifications and highly concentrated clusters of microcalcifications can introduce areas with apparent high elasticity in SWE. Considering that benign breast masses normally have significantly lower elasticity values than malignant tumors, such areas with high elasticity appearing due to presence of calcification in benign breast masses may lead to misdiagnosis.",2015
585,"Wang H,Lu C,Liu X,Zhang W",Metastatic and prognostic factors in patients with alveolar echinococcosis.,"Background: Prognostic predictions in alveolar echinococcosis (AE) are usually based on relapse and metastasis. Thus, assessment of factors associated with metastasis and clinical outcomes in patients with alveolar echinococcosis are of significant important. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlated factors for metastasis and prognosis for patients with AE. Methods: We analyzed 159 AE patients who underwent curative surgery at the First Teaching Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from February 2003 to December 2013 by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for CD44 was performed in 159 AE and adjacent normal liver specimens. The clinicopathological parameters were analyzed for metastasis and prognosis, including gender, age, size, calcification, necrosis, foreign body granuloma and CD44 protein level. Results: The rate of metastasis was 22.1%. Chi-square test showed that low levels of CD44 was associated with metastasis (P = 0.004). However, multivariate analysis suggested that CD44 expression is not independent prognostic indicators for overall survival (P = 0.356). In addition, no correlations between prognosis and gender, age, size, calcification, necrosis, foreign body granulomatous, metastasis were identified.

Moreover, ZFX expression abnormally increases in various cancers and relates to tumor grade. We performed this study, to examine its role in the pathogenesis of astrocytoma and meningioma. Materials and Methods:: We used real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method for evaluation of ZFX expression in 25 astrocytoma tumoral tissue and 25 meningioma tumoral tissues with different WHO grades. Furthermore, the association of gene expression with various clinic-pathological characteristics was examined. Results:: We found that there is a significant association between gene expression and different tumor grades, the presence or absence of invasion, forming and nonforming of glomeruloid vessels, the age over or under 50 and the presence or absence of calcification in astrocytomas. This is the first report that shows that ZFX was directly correlated with the central features of the neoplastic phenotype, including the growth of cancer cells, angiogenesis, and invasion. Conclusion:: Regarding all the above-mentioned studies, it is highly plausible that silencing the expression of ZFX gene in gliomas has a major role in the therapeutic interventions of the disease in future.",2015

Supersaturation is the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization, so it is believed that higher blood levels of calcium and phosphate increase the risk of cardiovascular calcification. However several factors can promote or inhibit the natural process of pathological calcification. This cross-sectional study evaluated the relationship between physiological levels of urinary phytate and heart valve calcification in a population of elderly out subjects. A population of 188 elderly subjects (mean age: 68 years) was studied. Valve calcification was measured by echocardiography. Phytate determination was performed from a urine sample and data on blood chemistry, end-systolic volume, concomitant diseases, cardiovascular risk factors, medication usage and food were obtained. The study population was classified in three tertiles according to level of urinary phytate: low (<0.610 μM), intermediate (0.61–1.21 μM), and high (>1.21 μM). Subjects with higher levels of urinary phytate had less mitral annulus calcification and were less likely to have diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. In the multivariate analysis, age, serum phosphorous, leukocytes total count and urinary phytate excretion appeared as independent factors predictive of presence of mitral annulus calcification. There was an inverse correlation between urinary phytate content and mitral annulus calcification in our population of elderly out subjects. These results suggest that consumption of phytate-rich foods may help to prevent cardiovascular calcification evolution.",2015
588,"De Vilder EY,Vanakker OM","From variome to phenome: Pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of ectopic mineralization disorders.","Ectopic mineralization - inappropriate biomineralization in soft tissues - is a frequent finding in physiological aging processes and several common disorders, which can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Further, pathologic mineralization is seen in several rare genetic disorders, which often present life-threatening phenotypes. These disorders are classified based on the mechanisms through which the mineralization occurs: metastatic or dystrophic calcification or ectopic ossification. Underlying mechanisms have been extensively studied, which resulted in several hypotheses regarding the etiology of mineralization in the extracellular matrix of soft tissue. These hypotheses include intracellular and extracellular mechanisms, such as the formation of matrix vesicles, aberrant osteogenic and chondrogenic signaling, apoptosis and oxidative stress. Though coherence between the different findings is not always clear, current insights have led to improvement of the diagnosis and management of ectopic mineralization patients, thus translating pathogenetic knowledge (variome) to the phenotype (phenome). In this review, we will focus on the clinical presentation, pathogenesis and management of primary genetic soft tissue mineralization disorders. As examples of dystrophic calcification disorders Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Generalized arterial calcification of infancy, Keutel syndrome, Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification and Arterial calcification due to CD73 (NT5E) deficiency will be discussed. Hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis will be reviewed as an example of mineralization disorders caused by metastatic calcification.",2015 Jul 16

While macrocalcification confers plaque stability, microcalcification is a key feature of high-risk atheroma and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Positron emission tomography and X-ray computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging of atherosclerosis using 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) has the potential to identify pathologically high-risk nascent microcalcification. However, the precise molecular mechanism of 18F-NaF vascular uptake is still unknown. Here we use electron microscopy, autoradiography, histology and preclinical and clinical PET/CT to analyse 18F-NaF binding. We show that 18F-NaF adsorbs to calcified deposits within plaque with high affinity and is selective and specific. 18F-NaF PET/CT imaging can distinguish between areas of macro- and microcalcification. This is the only currently available clinical imaging platform that can non-invasively detect microcalcification in active unstable atherosclerosis. The use of 18F-NaF may foster new approaches to developing treatments for vascular calcification.",2015

591,"Chistiakov DA,Sobenin IA,Orekhov AN,Bobryshev YV",Human miR-221/222 in Physiological and Atherosclerotic Vascular Remodeling.,"A cluster of miR-221/222 is a key player in vascular biology through exhibiting its effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs). These miRNAs contribute to vascular remodeling, an adaptive process involving phenotypic and behavioral changes in vascular cells in response to vascular injury. In proliferative vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, pathological vascular remodeling plays a prominent role. The miR-221/222 cluster controls development and differentiation of ECs but inhibits their proangiogenic activation, proliferation, and migration. miR-221/222 are primarily implicated in maintaining endothelial integrity and supporting quiescent EC phenotype. Vascular expression of miR-221/222 is upregulated in initial atherogenic stages causing inhibition of angiogenic recruitment of ECs and increasing endothelial dysfunction and EC apoptosis. In contrast, these miRNAs stimulate VSMCs and switching from the VSMC “contractile” phenotype to the “synthetic” phenotype associated with induction of proliferation and motility. In atherosclerotic vessels, miR-221/222 drive neointima formation. Both miRNAs contribute to atherogenic calcification of VSMCs. In advanced plaques, chronic inflammation downregulates miR-221/222 expression in ECs that in turn could activate intralesion neoangiogenesis. In addition, both miRNAs could contribute to cardiovascular pathology through their effects on fat and glucose metabolism in nonvascular tissues such as adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscles.",2015

Methods: A mammography image set containing subtle malignant non-calcification lesions, biopsy-proven benign lesions, simulated malignant calcification clusters and normals was acquired using amorphous-selenium (a-Se) detectors. The images were adapted to simulate four types of detectors at the same radiation dose: digital radiography (DR) detectors with a-Se and caesium iodide (CsI) convertors, and computed radiography (CR) detectors with a powder phosphor (PIP) and a needle phosphor (NIP). Seven observers marked suspicious and benign lesions. Analysis was undertaken using jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristics weighted figure of merit (FoM). The cancer detection fraction (CDF) was estimated for a representative image set from screening. Results: No significant differences in the FoMs between the DR detectors were measured. For calcification clusters and non-calcification lesions, both CR detectors’ FoMs were significantly lower than for DR detectors. The calcification cluster’s FoM for CR NIP was significantly better than for CR PIP. The estimated CDFs with CR PIP and CR NIP detectors were up to 15% and 22% lower respectively than for DR detectors. Conclusion: Cancer detection is affected by detector type and the use of CR in mammography should be reconsidered.",2016 Mar

Although there are several theories as to how these crystals can develop through the combined interactions of biochemical and biophysical factors, the exact mechanism of such mineralization is largely unknown. Based on the published scientific literature, we found that common factors can link the initial stages of stone formation and calcification in anatomically distal tissues and organs. For example, changes to the spatiotemporal conditions of the fluid flow in tubular structures may provide initial condition(s) for CaP crystal generation needed for stone formation. Additionally, recent evidence has provided a meaningful association between the active participation of proteins and transcription factors found in the bone forming (ossification) mechanism that are also involved in the early stages of kidney stone formation and arterial calcification. Our review will focus on three topics of discussion (physiological influences—calcium and phosphate concentration—and similarities to ossification, or bone formation) that may elucidate some commonality in the mechanisms of stone formation and calcification, and pave the way towards opening new avenues for further research.",2015 Sep
594,Buscombe JR,Exploring the nature of atheroma and cardiovascular inflammation in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET).,"Positron emission tomography (PET) has become widely established in oncology. Subsequently, a whole new “toolbox” of tracers have become available to look at different aspects of cancer cell function and dysfunction, including cell protein production, DNA synthesis, hypoxia and angiogenesis. In the past 5 years, these tools have been used increasingly to look at the other great killer of the developed world: cardiovascular disease. For example, inflammation of the unstable plaque can be imaged with 18-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), and this uptake can be quantified to show the effect that statins have in reducing inflammation and explains how these drugs can reduce the risk of stroke. 18F-FDG has also become established in diagnosing and monitoring large-vessel vasculitis and has now entered routine practice. Other agents such as gallium-68 (68Ga) octreotide have been shown to identify vascular inflammation possibly more specifically than 18F-FDG. Hypoxia within the plaque can be imaged with 18F-fluoromisonidazole and resulting angiogenesis with 18F-RGD peptides. Active calcification such as that found in unstable atheromatous plaques can be imaged with 18F-NaF. PET imaging enables us to understand the mechanisms by which cardiovascular disease, including atheroma, leads to morbidity and death and thus increases the chance of finding new and effective treatments.",2015 Sep

The images were reevaluated by two dedicated breast imaging experts according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. The sonographic features of 45 TNBC patients were compared with those of 100 non-TNBC patients. Results: TNBC showed a high histological tumor grade. On ultrasound, TNBC was more frequently to present as oval or round mass shape (48.9%, 17.8%; respectively), more likely to have circumscribed margins (82.2%), and less likely to show posterior attenuating (8.9%). Additionally, compared with non-TNBC, TNBC was less likely to have calcification (35.6%). Conclusion: TNBC has distinguishing imaging features on breast ultrasound, and more likely to be associated with benign masses.

CT images and clinical features of 18 patients with 36 histopathologically proven pancreatic metastases were retrospectively reviewed. The primary malignancy included non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n = 7), gastrointestinal carcinoma (n = 5), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n = 3), osteosarcoma (n = 1), cardiac sarcomas (n = 1), and neuroendocrine ethmoid sinus carcinoma (n = 1). Pancreatic metastases were metachronous in 12 patients (ranging from 4 to 72 months). Tumor markers were elevated for 8 patients, of which 7 patients had NSCLC and gastrointestinal carcinoma, and 1 patient had osteosarcoma. Metastases from NSCLC and gastrointestinal carcinoma frequently presented as small well-circumscribed lesions, with homogeneous or rim enhancement, and or local pancreatic infiltration instead of focal mass, mimicking local pancreatitis. Neuroendocrine ethmoid sinus carcinoma affecting the pancreas also exhibited local pancreatic infiltration. Metastases from RCC and cardiac sarcomas had typical characteristics of hypervascular lesions. Osteosarcoma metastasizing to pancreas had special manifestation, that is, cystic lesion with thick wall and calcification.Although pancreatic metastases have a broad spectrum of CT appearances, lesions from some types of primary tumors exhibited characteristic imaging features, which, in combination with oncological history, will contribute to correct diagnosis.",2015 Jun

In this study, we aimed to apply an ensemble decision approach to identify the ultrasound and clinical features related to the molecular subtypes. We collected ultrasound and clinical features from 1,000 breast cancer patients and performed immunohistochemistry on these samples. We used the ensemble decision approach to select unique features and to construct decision models. The decision model for Luminal-A subtype was constructed based on the presence of an echogenic halo and post-acoustic shadowing or indifference. The decision model for Luminal-B subtype was constructed based on the absence of an echogenic halo and vascularity. The decision model for HER2-amplified subtype was constructed based on the presence of post-acoustic enhancement, calcification, vascularity and advanced age. The model for Triple-negative subtype followed two rules. One was based on irregular shape, lobulate margin contour, the absence of calcification and hypovascularity, whereas the other was based on oval shape, hypovascularity and micro-lobulate margin contour. The accuracies of the models were 83.8%, 77.4%, 87.9% and 92.7%, respectively. We identified specific features of each molecular subtype and expanded the scope of ultrasound for making diagnoses using these decision models.",2015

599,"Uda H,Tomioka YK,Sugawara Y,Sarukawa S,Sunaga A",Shaping of the Unaffected Breast with Brava-Assisted Autologous Fat Grafting to Obtain Symmetry after Breast Reconstruction.,"Background: In breast reconstruction, symmetry is a vital issue. However, when the original breast is unusually shaped or the patient desires augmentation at the time of reconstruction, obtaining symmetrical breasts becomes difficult. Objectives: The authors performed shaping of unaffected breasts by Brava-assisted autologous fat grafting to enhance breast symmetry, and evaluated the clinical results to validate this new approach. Methods: Brava-assisted autologous fat grafting was performed to the unaffected breasts of 12 patients who had undergone unilateral breast reconstruction. The procedure was used for augmentation in six patients and to correct ptosis, volume, and tuberous breast deformity in three, two, and one patient, respectively. Clinical outcomes were assessed in all 12 patients. Results: All patients could complete fat grafting within two sessions (one session in nine patients and two sessions in three patients). The mean volume of grafted fat per session was 211 cc in all patients. The mean retention rate of grafted fat was 58.9% in the 10 patients for whom the retention rate could be calculated using preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Postoperative MRI revealed small benign foci in two patients (16.7%), which were not palpable and did not become a clinical problem. A postoperative mammography revealed a small agglutinate calcification in one patient, which was determined to be benign through biopsy. Conclusions: Shaping the unaffected breast by autologous fat grafting combined with Brava is predictable, effective, and feasible as an aesthetic adjunct to unilateral breast reconstruction to achieve breast symmetry.

In this study, we sought to clarify the mechanism of CAVD by assessing a genetic mutation, Notch1 heterozygosity, which leads to CAVD with 100% penetrance in humans. Approach and Results: Murine immortalized Notch1+/− aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) were isolated and expanded in vitro. Molecular signaling of wild type (WT) and Notch1+/− AVICs were compared to identify changes in pathways that have been linked to CAVD – TGFβ/BMP, MAPK and PI3K/Akt – and assessed for calcification potential. Additionally, AVIC mechanobiology was studied in a physiologically relevant, dynamic mechanical environment (10% cyclic strain) to investigate differences in responses between the cell types. We found that Notch1+/− AVICs resembled a myofibroblast-like phenotype expressing higher amounts of cadherin-11, a known mediator of dystrophic calcification, and decreased Runx2, a known osteogenic marker. We determined that cadherin-11 expression is regulated by Akt activity, and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation significantly reduced cadherin-11 expression. Moreover, in the presence of cyclic strain, Notch1+/− AVICs exhibited significantly upregulated phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and smooth muscle α-actin (αSMA) expression, indicative of a fully activated myofibroblast. Finally, these Notch1 mediated alterations led to enhanced dystrophic calcific nodule formation. Conclusions: This study presents novel insights in our understanding of Notch1-mediated CAVD by demonstrating that the mutation leads to AVICs that are fully activated myofibroblasts, resulting in dystrophic, but not osteogenic, calcification.",2015 Jul

602,"Dudev T,Musset B,Morgan D,Cherny VV,Smith SME,Mazmanian K,DeCoursey TE,Lim C","Selectivity Mechanism of the Voltage-gated Proton Channel, HV1.","Voltage-gated proton channels, HV1, trigger bioluminescence in dinoflagellates, enable calcification in coccolithophores, and play multifarious roles in human health. Because the proton concentration is minuscule, exquisite selectivity for protons over other ions is critical to HV1 function. The selectivity of the open HV1 channel requires an aspartate near an arginine in the selectivity filter (SF), a narrow region that dictates proton selectivity, but the mechanism of proton selectivity is unknown. Here we use a reduced quantum model to elucidate how the Asp–Arg SF selects protons but excludes other ions. Attached to a ring scaffold, the Asp and Arg side chains formed bidentate hydrogen bonds that occlude the pore. Introducing H3O+ protonated the SF, breaking the Asp–Arg linkage and opening the conduction pathway, whereas Na+ or Cl– was trapped by the SF residue of opposite charge, leaving the linkage intact, thus preventing permeation. An Asp–Lys SF behaved like the Asp–Arg one and was experimentally verified to be proton-selective, as predicted. Hence, interacting acidic and basic residues form favorable AspH0–H2O0–Arg+ interactions with hydronium but unfavorable Asp––X–/X+–Arg+ interactions with anions/cations. This proposed mechanism may apply to other proton-selective molecules engaged in bioenergetics, homeostasis, and signaling.",2015

A physical examination revealed bilateral nipple retraction and a non-tender mass in the left breast, with little nipple discharge. Tests revealed high levels of carbohydrate antigen 125, serum prolactin and testosterone levels, and ultrasound revealed a number of masses in the bilateral breasts; the largest mass (2.2×1.3 cm) was located in the left breast. A rich blood flow signal was identified around the nodule. The ducts in the bilateral breasts exhibited cystic ectasia. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes were found in the bilateral axillae. Mammography revealed thickened breast tissue without an evident mass, and calcification. A segmental mastectomy was performed and subsequent histological examination revealed multiple dilated ducts, the largest of which contained eosinophilic material. The pathological diagnosis was of breast duct dilatation. Bacterial culture and drug sensitivity analysis of the secretions from the cystic cavity revealed no bacterial growth, and an acid fast bacillus stain was negative.

Sonograms revealed that all masses exhibited a hypoechoic internal echo texture (9/9) and that a number of masses presented with an irregular shape (8/9), obscure boundary (5/9), partially microlobulated (5/9) or well-circumscribed (4/9) margins, and an inhomogeneous echo (8/9). Mammographic imaging revealed increased radiological density masses (6/8), and sand-like calcification was not observed in all patients. In two patients, the tumors were mammographically occult. Magnetic resonance imaging performed on one patient revealed a slightly high signal intensity on fat-saturated T1- and T2-weighted images. Following contrast enhancement, a homogeneous early enhancement was revealed with a quick ascent and quick descent time-density curve. Immunohistochemistry revealed that all ICCs expressed estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, but that none were positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2.

A random sample of 100 reports was manually abstracted to evaluate the accuracy of the system. Results: The NLP system correctly coded 96 to 99 out of our sample of 100 reports depending on findings. Measures of sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive values exceeded 0.92 for all findings. Positive predictive values were relatively low for some findings due to their low prevalence. Discussion: Our NLP system was implemented entirely in SAS Base, which makes it portable and easy to implement. It performed reasonably well with multiple applications, such as using confidence flags as a filter to improve the efficiency of manual review. Refinements of library and association rules, and testing on more diverse samples may further improve its performance. Conclusion: Our NLP system successfully extracts clinically useful information from mammography reports. Moreover, SAS is a feasible platform for implementing NLP algorithms.",2015 Apr

Although CT is considered superior in detecting calcification, its ionizing radiation, especially in patients with hereditary retinoblastoma, should be avoided. The purpose of our study was to validate T2*WI for the detection of calcification in retinoblastoma with ex vivo CT as the criterion standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Twenty-two consecutive patients with retinoblastoma (mean age, 21 months; range, 1–71 months) with enucleation as primary treatment were imaged at 1.5T by using a dedicated surface coil. Signal-intensity voids indicating calcification on T2*WI were compared with ex vivo high-resolution CT, and correlation was scored by 2 independent observers as poor, good, or excellent. Other parameters included the shape and location of the signal-intensity voids. In 5 tumors, susceptibility-weighted images were evaluated. RESULTS:: All calcifications visible on high-resolution CT could be matched with signal-intensity voids on T2*WI, and correlation was scored as excellent in 17 (77%) and good in 5 (23%) eyes. In total, 93% (25/27) of the signal-intensity voids inside the tumor correlated with calcifications compared with none (0/8) of the signal-intensity voids outside the tumor. Areas of nodular signal-intensity voids correlated with calcifications in 92% (24/26), and linear signal-intensity voids correlated with hemorrhage in 67% (6/9) of cases. The correlation of signal-intensity voids on SWI was better in 4 of 5 tumors compared with T2*WI. CONCLUSIONS:: Signal-intensity voids on in vivo T2*WI correlate well with calcifications on ex vivo high-resolution CT in retinoblastoma. Gradient-echo sequences may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of retinoblastoma. The combination of funduscopy, sonography, and high-resolution MR imaging with gradient-echo sequences should become the standard diagnostic approach for retinoblastoma.",2015 Feb
611,"Wu G,Guo JJ,Ma ZY,Wang J,Zhou ZW,Wang Y",Correlation between calcification and bone sialoprotein and osteopontin in papillary thyroid carcinoma.,"The correlation between calcification and papillary thyroid carcinoma has received increasing attention. We investigated the ability of bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteopontin (OPN) protein levels to diagnose papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and explored the correlation between BSP and OPN protein levels and calcification in PTC. Archival PTC specimens from patients with PTC with calcification and lateral cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) were included in this retrospective immunohistochemical study. The protein levels of BSP and OPN were analysed immunohistochemically using routinely prepared tissue sections. PTC specimens from 66 patients with PTC were reviewed retrospectively (25 patients with histological calcification seen in paraffin sections, 41 patients without calcification; 35 patients with lateral cervical LNM, 31 patients without LNM). The percentage of samples that had cells that demonstrated positive protein staining differed significantly between PTC specimens, benign thyroid nodules, and adjacent normal follicular epithelium (BSP: 87.88%, 55.00%, and 42.50%, respectively; OPN: 83.33%, 70.00% and 50.00%, respectively). There was a significant difference in the immunohistochemical score (IHS) for BSP and OPN protein staining between PTC specimens with and without calcification (P < 0.05). The level of BSP protein staining was found to be significantly correlated with the level of OPN protein staining in PTC specimens. We conclude that the strong correlation between BSP and OPN and PTC suggests a role for BSP and OPN in calcification and tumor progression of PTC. BSP and OPN might be useful tumour markers for the diagnosis of PTC with limited value, because both of them had low specificity.",2015
612,"Louvet L,Bazin D,Büchel J,Steppan S,Passlick-Deetjen J,Massy ZA",Characterisation of Calcium Phosphate Crystals on Calcified Human Aortic Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells and Potential Role of Magnesium.,"Background: Cardiovascular disease including vascular calcification (VC) remains the leading cause of death in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD). The process of VC seems likely to be a tightly regulated process where vascular smooth muscle cells are playing a key role rather than just a mere passive precipitation of calcium phosphate. Characterisation of the chemical and crystalline structure of VC was mainly led in patients or animal models with CKD. Likewise, Mg2+ was found to be protective in living cells although a potential role for Mg2+ could not be excluded on crystal formation and precipitation. In this study, the crystal formation and the role of Mg2+ were investigated in an in vitro model of primary human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HAVSMC) with physical techniques. Methodology/Principal Findings: In HAVSMC incubated with increased Ca x Pi medium, only calcium phosphate apatite crystals (CPA) were detected by Micro-Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy (µFTIR) and Field Effect Scanning Electron Microscope (FE — SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) at the cell layer level. Supplementation with Mg2+ did not alter the crystal composition or structure. The crystal deposition was preferentially positioned near or directly on cells as pictured by FE — SEM observations and EDX measurements. Large µFTIR maps revealed spots of CPA crystals that were associated to the cellular layout. This qualitative analysis suggests a potential beneficial effect of Mg2+ at 5 mM in noticeably reducing the number and intensities of CPA µFTIR spots. Conclusions/Significance: For the first time in a model of HAVSMC, induced calcification led to the formation of the sole CPA crystals. Our data seems to exclude a physicochemical role of Mg2+ in altering the CPA crystal growth, composition or structure. Furthermore, Mg2+ beneficial role in attenuating VC should be linked to an active cellular role.",2015

Identifying and monitoring process measures for screening is a focus of the National Cancer Institute’s Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) initiative, which requires participating centers to report structured data across the cancer screening continuum. We evaluate the accuracy of automated information extraction of imaging findings from radiology reports, which are available as unstructured text. We present prevalence estimates of imaging findings for breast imaging received by women who obtained care in a primary care network participating in PROSPR (n = 139,953 radiology reports) and compared automatically extracted data elements to a “gold standard” based on manual review for a validation sample of 941 randomly selected radiology reports, including mammograms, digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The prevalence of imaging findings vary by data element and modality (e.g., suspicious calcification noted in 2.6 % of screening mammograms, 12.1 % of diagnostic mammograms, and 9.4 % of tomosynthesis exams). In the validation sample, the accuracy of identifying imaging findings, including suspicious calcifications, masses, and architectural distortion (on mammogram and tomosynthesis); masses, cysts, non-mass enhancement, and enhancing foci (on MRI); and masses and cysts (on ultrasound), range from 0.8 to1.0 for recall, precision, and F-measure. Information extraction tools can be used for accurate documentation of imaging findings as structured data elements from text reports for a variety of breast imaging modalities. These data can be used to populate screening registries to help elucidate more effective breast cancer screening processes.",2015 Oct
615,Miller PD,Chronic kidney disease and the skeleton.,"Fractures across the stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) could be due to osteoporosis, some form of renal osteodystrophy defined by specific quantitative histomorphometry or chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD–MBD). CKD–MBD is a systemic disease that links disorders of mineral and bone metabolism due to CKD to either one or all of the following: abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone or vitamin D metabolism; abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth or strength; or vascular or other soft-tissue calcification. Osteoporosis, as defined by the National Institutes of Health, may coexist with renal osteodystrophy or CKD–MBD. Differentiation among these disorders is required to manage correctly the correct disorder to reduce the risk of fractures. While the World Health Organization (WHO) bone mineral density (BMD) criteria for osteoporosis can be used in patients with stages 1–3 CKD, the disorders of bone turnover become so aberrant by stages 4 and 5 CKD that neither the WHO criteria nor the occurrence of a fragility fracture can be used for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. The diagnosis of osteoporosis in stages 4 and 5 CKD is one of the exclusion—excluding either renal osteodystrophy or CKD–MBD as the cause of low BMD or fragility fractures. Differentiations among the disorders of renal osteodystrophy, CKD–MBD or osteoporosis are dependent on the measurement of specific biochemical markers, including serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and/or quantitative bone histomorphometry. Management of fractures in stages 1–3 CKD does not differ in persons with or without CKD with osteoporosis assuming that there is no evidence for CKD–MBD, clinically suspected by elevated PTH, hyperphosphatemia or fibroblast growth factor 23 due to CKD. Treatment of fractures in persons with osteoporosis and stages 4 and 5 CKD is not evidence-based, with the exception of post-hoc analysis suggesting efficacy and safety of specific osteoporosis therapies (alendronate, risedronate and denosumab) in stage 4 CKD. This review also discusses how to diagnose and manage fragility fractures across the five stages of CKD.",2014

An 87-year-old male presented with recurrent lower urinary tract infections and was found to have an obstructing large calcified mass in the right lobe of the prostate. Subsequently, he underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and bladder neck with laser lithotripsy to remove the calculus. We propose that chronic inflammation and necrosis of the prostate from cryotherapy resulted in dystrophic calcification of the prostate. As the use of cryotherapy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer continues to increase, it is important that clinicians be aware of this scenario and the technical challenges it poses.",2014

METHODS:: Among 837 patients referred to our radiology department for mammographic screening, 310 postmenopausal females (105 patients with and 205 patients without breast arterial calcification) aged 40 to 73 (mean 55.9±8.4) years were included in this study. The groups were compared with respect to clinical characteristics and metabolic syndrome criteria. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified the factors related to breast arterial calcification. RESULTS:: Age, postmenopausal duration and the frequencies of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and metabolic syndrome were significantly higher in the subjects with breast arterial calcification than in those without (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis indicated that age (OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1–1.6, p = 0.001) and metabolic syndrome (OR = 4.0, 95% CI = 1.5−10.4, p = 0.005) were independent predictors of breast arterial calcification detected via mammography. The independent predictors among the features of metabolic syndrome were low levels of high-density lipoproteins (OR = 8.1, 95% CI = 1.0−64.0, p = 0.047) and high blood pressure (OR = 8.7, 95% CI = 1.5−49.7, p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS:: The likelihood of mammographic detection of breast arterial calcification increases with age and in the presence of hypertension or metabolic syndrome. For patients undergoing screening mammography who present with breast arterial calcification, the possibility of metabolic syndrome should be considered. These patients should be informed of their cardiovascular risk factors and counseled on appropriate lifestyle changes.",2014 Dec

Imaging modalities used to date for its evaluation have limitations in their ability to fully characterize intra-articular crystal deposition. Since Computed Tomography (CT) imaging provides excellent visualization of bones and calcified tissue, in this pilot project we evaluated the utility of CT scan in describing intra-articular calcium crystal deposition in the knees. Method: We included 12 subjects with and 4 subjects without radiographic chondrocalcinosis in the most recent visit from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) study, which is a longitudinal cohort of community-dwelling older adults with or at risk for knee OA. All subjects underwent CT scans of bilateral knees. Each knee was divided into 25 subregions and each subregion was read for presence of calcium crystals by a musculoskeletal radiologist. To assess reliability, readings were repeated 4 weeks later. Results: CT images permitted visualization of 25 subregions with calcification within and around the tibio-femoral and patello-femoral joints in all 24 knees with radiographic chondrocalcinosis. Intra-articular calcification was seen universally including meniscal cartilage (most common site involved in 21/24 knees), hyaline cartilage, cruciate ligaments, medial collateral ligament and joint capsule. Readings showed good agreement for specific tissues involved with calcium deposition (kappa: 0.70, 95% CI 0.62–0.80). Conclusion: We found CT scan to be a useful and reliable tool for describing calcium crystal deposition in the knee and therefore potentially for studying role of calcium crystals in OA. We also confirmed that “chondrocalcinosis” is a misnomer because calcification is present ubiquitously.",2015 Feb

An osteogenic Msx-Wnt regulatory program is concomitantly upregulated in the vasculature. To better understand the mechanisms of diabetic arteriosclerosis, we generated SM22-Cre;Msx1(fl/fl);Msx2(fl/fl);LDLR−/− mice, assessing the impact of Msx1+Msx2 gene deletion in vascular myofibroblast and smooth muscle cells. Aortic Msx2 and Msx1 were decreased by 95% and 34% in SM22-Cre;Msx1(fl/fl);Msx2(fl/fl);LDLR−/− animals versus Msx1(fl/fl);Msx2(fl/fl);LDLR−/− controls, respectively. Aortic calcium was reduced by 31%, and pulse wave velocity, an index of stiffness, was decreased in SM22-Cre;Msx1(fl/fl);Msx2(fl/fl);LDLR−/− mice vs. controls. Fasting blood glucose and lipids did not differ, yet SM22-Cre;Msx1(fl/fl);Msx2(fl/fl);LDLR−/− siblings became more obese. Aortic adventitial myofibroblasts from SM22-Cre;Msx1(fl/fl);Msx2(fl/fl);LDLR−/− mice exhibited reduced osteogenic gene expression and mineralizing potential with concomitant reduction in multiple Wnt genes. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Sca1, markers of aortic osteogenic progenitors, were also reduced, paralleling a 78% reduction in alkaline phosphatase (TNAP)–positive adventitial myofibroblasts. RNA interference revealed that although Msx1+Msx2 supports TNAP and Wnt7b expression, Msx1 selectively maintains Shh and Msx2 sustains Wnt2, Wnt5a, and Sca1 expression in aortic adventitial myofibroblast cultures. Thus, Msx1 and Msx2 support vascular mineralization by directing the osteogenic programming of aortic progenitors in diabetic arteriosclerosis.",2014 Dec
620,"Deng L,Huang L,Sun Y,Heath JM,Wu H,Chen Y",INHIBITION OF FOXO1/3 PROMOTES VASCULAR CALCIFICATION.,"Objective: Vascular calcification is a characteristic feature of atherosclerosis, diabetes and end-stage renal disease. We have demonstrated that activation of AKT upregulates Runx2, a key osteogenic transcription factor that is crucial for calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Using mice with SMC-specific deletion of PTEN, a major negative regulator of AKT, the present studies uncovered a novel molecular mechanism underlying PTEN/AKT/FOXO-mediated Runx2 upregulation and VSMC calcification. Approaches and Results: SMC-specific PTEN deletion mice were generated by crossing PTEN floxed mice with SM22α-Cre transgenic mice. The PTEN deletion resulted in sustained activation of AKT that upregulated Runx2 and promoted VSMC calcification in vitro and arterial calcification ex vivo. Runx2 knockdown did not affect proliferation but blocked calcification of the PTEN deficient VSMC, suggesting that PTEN deletion promotes Runx2-depedent VSMC calcification that is independent of proliferation. At the molecular level, PTEN deficiency increased the amount of Runx2 post-transcriptionally by inhibiting Runx2 ubiquitination. AKT activation increased phosphorylation of FOXO1/3 that led to nuclear exclusion of FOXO1/3. FOXO1/3 knockdown in VSMC phenocopied the PTEN deficiency, demonstrating a novel function of FOXO1/3, as a downstream signaling of PTEN/AKT, in regulating Runx2 ubiquitination and VSMC calcification. Using heterozygous SMC-specific PTEN deficient mice and atherogenic ApoE−/− mice, we further demonstrated AKT activation, FOXO phosphorylation and Runx2 ubiquitination in vascular calcification in vivo. Conclusions: Our studies have determined a new causative effect of SMC-specific PTEN deficiency on vascular calcification, and demonstrated that FOXO1/3 plays a crucial role in PTEN/AKT-modulated Runx2 ubiquitination and VSMC calcification.",2015 Jan
621,"Deng XS,Meng X,Zeng Q,Fullerton D,Mitchell M,Jaggers J",Adult Aortic Valve Interstitial Cells Have Greater Responses to Toll-Like Receptor 4 Stimulation.,"Background: Aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) possesses antiinflammatory effects. Given that calcification occurs in adult valves, we hypothesized that AVICs from adult valves more likely undergo a proosteogenic phenotypic change than those from pediatric valves and that may be related to different Stat3 activation in the response of those two age groups to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Methods: AVICs from healthy human aortic valve tissues were treated with TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide. Cellular levels of TLR4, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as phosphorylation of p-38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-κβ (NF-κβ), and Stat3, were analyzed. Results: Toll-like receptor 4 protein levels were comparable between adult and pediatric AVICs. Adult cells produce markedly higher levels of the above markers after TLR4 stimulation, which is negatively associated with phosphorylation of Stat3. Inhibition of Stat3 enhanced p-38 MAPK and N-κβ phosphorylation and exaggerated the expression of the above markers in pediatric AVICs after TLR4 stimulation. Conclusions: Adult AVICs exhibit greater inflammatory and osteogenic responses to TLR4 stimulation. The enhanced responses in adult AVICs are at least partly due to lower levels of Stat3 activation in response to TLR4 stimulation relative to pediatric cells. Stat3 functions as a negative regulator of the TLR4 responses in human AVICs. The results suggest that Stat3 activation (tyrosine phosphorylation) may be protective and that TLR4 inhibition could be targeted pharmacologically to treat calcific aortic valve disease.",2015 Jan

RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway modifications and the crosstalk between metastatic cells and bone have been indicated as potential drivers of the process. Interactions between tumor and bone cells have been studied in vivo and in vitro, but specific effects of the direct contact between human metastatic cells and human bone cells on RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway have not been investigated. Findings: We directly co-cultured bone metastatic human breast cancer cells (BOKL) with osteo-differentiated human mesenchymal cells (BMSCs) from 3 different donors. BMSCs and BOKL were then enzymatically separated and FACS sorted. We found a significant increase in the RANKL/OPG ratio as compared to control, which was not observed in BOKL cultured in medium conditioned by BMSCs, neither in BOKL directly cultured with fibroblasts or medium conditioned by fibroblasts. Direct co-culture with osteo-differentiated BMSCs caused BOKL aggregation while proliferation was not affected by co-culture. To more specifically associate RANKL expression to osteogenic differentiation degree of BMSCs, we determined their osteogenic markers expression and matrix calcification relative to osteoblasts and fibroblasts. Conclusions: In conclusion, our co-culture model allowed to demonstrate for the first time that direct contact but not paracrine interactions between human metastatic breast cancer cells and bone cells has a significant effect on RANKL/OPG expression in bone metastatic cells. Furthermore, only direct contact with the bone microenvironment induced BOKL clustering without however significantly influencing their proliferation and migration.

623,"Arts FA,Velghe AI,Stevens M,Renauld JC,Essaghir A,Demoulin JB",Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification-associated PDGFRB mutations impair the receptor signalling.,"Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) bind to two related receptor tyrosine kinases, which are encoded by the PDGFRA and PDGFRB genes. Recently, heterozygous PDGFRB mutations have been described in patients diagnosed with idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC or Fahr disease), a rare inherited neurological disorder. The goal of the present study was to determine whether these mutations had a positive or negative impact on the PDGFRB activity. We first showed that the E1071V mutant behaved like wild-type PDGFRB and may represent a polymorphism unrelated to IBGC. In contrast, the L658P mutant had no kinase activity and failed to activate any of the pathways normally stimulated by PDGF. The R987W mutant activated Akt and MAP kinases but did not induce the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) after PDGF stimulation. Phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ was also decreased. Finally, we showed that the R987W mutant was more rapidly degraded upon PDGF binding compared to wild-type PDGFRB. In conclusion, PDGFRB mutations associated with IBGC impair the receptor signalling. PDGFRB loss of function in IBGC is consistent with recently described inactivating mutations in the PDGF-B ligand. These results raise concerns about the long-term safety of PDGF receptor inhibition by drugs such as imatinib.",2015 Jan

Aims:: The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical, pathological and immunohistochemical features of lipoleiomyoma of the uterine corpus, and review its histogenesis and differential diagnosis from other neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions in order to obtain a detailed profile of this somewhat uncommon lesion. Study Design:: Descriptive study. Methods:: This study is a retrospective analysis of 70 consecutive women with 76 lipoleiomyomas, who underwent surgery mainly for uterine leiomyoma and gynecological carcinomas between January 2000 and April 2013. Clinical and pathological information was obtained from medical records. Immunohistochemistry was applied in selected cases. Parametric methods were used to compare clinical and pathologic features. Results:: The patients ranged in age from 34 to 77 years (mean 55.49 years). Lipoleiomyomas ranged from 0.5 to 55 cm in diameter (mean 5.50 cm). Typical macroscopic and microscopic features were noted. Sixty-nine (90.7%) tumors were in the uterine corpus and five (6.5%) were in the cervix. One broad ligament tumor and one retroperitoneal tumor were also studied. No tumors displayed cytologic atypia, mitosis, necrosis, calcification, or other degenerative changes. Immunohistochemically, the adipose tissue element was positive for vimentin, desmin, S100 protein, estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Ki-67. Among patients with lipoleiomyomas, 53 cases (75.7%) had different types of lesions associated with hyperestrogenic status, such as adenomyosis, endometriosis, endometrial hyperplasia, and polyps, complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia, and gynecologic carcinomas. The follow-up period ranged from one to eight years (mean 4.6 years). There were no recurrences or tumor-related fatalities. Conclusion:: In the present study, the lipoleiomyomas were seen more frequently in patients with adenomyosis, endometriosis, endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and various gynecologic carcinomas.

Further, negative sputum and bronchoscopic results are common. Early diagnosis is equally as significant as treatment in the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with pulmonary TB. Aims:: The aim of this study was to assess computed tomography (CT) findings of pulmonary TB, confirmed via percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy (PTNB), and to correlate these findings with coexisting, underlying, lung diseases if present. Study Design:: Cross sectional study. Methods:: We selected eighty-four patients who were diagnosed with pulmonary TB by way of PTNB. Initially, acid-fast bacilli smear test results from these patients were negative. CT findings were reviewed to detect the presence of parenchymal abnormalities as follows: nodule(s) (<3 cm in diameter), mass (any masses ≥3 cm), daughter nodules, air-space consolidation, cavitation, calcification, lymphadenopathy, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and associated lung parenchymal disease. Results:: The CT findings of pulmonary TB confirmed by PTNB included nodules in 44 of 84 (52.4%) cases; 15 of these 44 cases (34.1%) had daughter nodules. The second most common finding was masses in 24 cases (28.6%), nine of which also had daughter nodules. 16 cases (19.0%) displayed nonsegmental consolidation. Of these 16 cases, four had coexisting usual interstitial pneumonia; four others had emphysema. Two patients with a mass had underlying pneumoconiosis. Conclusion:: Nodules or a mass mimicking lung cancer were the most common findings on CT scans in patients with pulmonary TB, confirmed via PTNB. The second most common finding was airspace consolidation. Therefore, PNTB is useful for the accurate diagnosis of pulmonary TB in the following cases: airspace consolidation or mass associated with underlying usual interstitial pneumonia, emphysema mimicking lung malignancy or cases of bacterial pneumonia.",2014 Sep

We assessed whether yam root (tuber) or bark (peel) extracts stimulated the activity of osteoblasts for osteogenesis. MC3T3-E1 cells (mouse osteoblasts) were treated with yam root extracts (water or methanol) (study I) or bark extracts (water or hexane) (study II) within 0~10 μg/mL during the periods of osteoblast proliferation (5~10 day), matrix maturation (11~15 day) and mineralization (16~20 day) as appropriate. In study I, both yam root water and methanol extracts increased cell proliferation as concentration-dependent manner. Cellular collagen synthesis and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, both the indicators of bone matrix protein and inorganic phosphate production for calcification respectively, were also increased by yam root water and methanol extract. Osteoblast calcification as cell matrix Ca and P accumulation was also increased by the addition of yam root extracts. In study II, yam bark extracts (water and hexane) increased osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, as collagen synthesis and ALP activity and osteoblast matrix Ca and P deposition. The study results suggested that both yam root and bark extracts stimulate osteogenic function in osteoblasts by stimulating bone matrix maturation by increasing collagen synthesis, ALP activity, and matrix mineralization.",2014 Sep

We report a case of a 51-year-old man with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast with multiple calcified brain metastases. After modified radical mastectomy he received adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, hormonal therapy and trastuzumab. About one year after initial diagnosis he developed a generalized epileptic seizure. Neuroradiological imaging (MRI) revealed multiple calcified intracerebral lesions. Cerebral toxoplasmosis was suggested. Histopathological examination verified metastases from breast cancer and subsequently palliative whole brain irradiation (30 Gy) were performed. A follow-up CT scan of the lung and abdomen showed a progression of extracerebral metastases. Calcification of brain metastases in patients with breast cancer is very rare. Due to their non-characteristical radiological appearance, such as multiple lesions and lack of contrast enhancement, diagnosis of metastases can be difficult. Infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis and cysticercosis should be considered within the diagnostic workup. It remains unclear to what extant calcification of brain metastases reflects certain tumor biology, or may be related to a treatment effect.",2014 Sep

Methods: We collected 21 cores containing microcalcifications (n = 11, microcalcification group) and none (n = 10, control group) in stereotactic or ultrasound (US) guided 8-gauge vacuum-assisted biopsies. Photoacoustic (PA) images were acquired through ex vivo experiments by transmitting laser pulses with two different wavelengths (700 nm and 800 nm). The presence of microcalcifications in PA images were blindly assessed by two radiologists and compared with specimen mammography. A ratio of the signal amplitude occurring at 700 nm to that occurring at 800 nm was calculated for each PA focus and was called the PAI ratio. Results: Based on the change of PA signal amplitude between 700 nm and 800 nm, 10 out of 11 specimens containing microcalcifications and 8 out of 10 specimens without calcifications were correctly identified on blind review; the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive and negative predictive values of our blind review were 90.91%, 80.0%, 85.71%, 83.33% and 88.89%. The PAI ratio in the microcalcification group was significantly higher than that in the control group (the median PAI ratio, 2.46 versus 1.11, respectively, P = .001). On subgroup analysis in the microcalcification group, neither malignant diagnosis nor the number or size of calcification-foci was proven to contribute to PAI ratios. Conclusion: Breast microcalcifications generated distinguishable PA signals unlike breast tissue without calcifications. So, PAI, a non-ionizing and non-invasive hybrid imaging technique, can be an alternative in overcoming the limitations of conventional US imaging.",2014
630,"Nishimoto SK,Nishimoto M",Matrix Gla Protein Binds to Fibronectin and Enhances Cell Attachment and Spreading on Fibronectin.,"Background. Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vitamin K-dependent, extracellular matrix protein. MGP is a calcification inhibitor of arteries and cartilage. However MGP is synthesized in many tissues and is especially enriched in embryonic tissues and in cancer cells. The presence of MGP in those instances does not correlate well with the calcification inhibitory role. This study explores a potential mechanism for MGP to bind to matrix proteins and alter cell matrix interactions. Methods. To determine whether MGP influences cell behavior through interaction with fibronectin, we studied MGP binding to fibronectin, the effect of MGP on fibronectin mediated cell attachment and spreading and immunolocalized MGP and fibronectin. Results. First, MGP binds to fibronectin. The binding site for MGP is in a specific fibronectin fragment, called III1-C or anastellin. The binding site for fibronectin is in a MGP C-terminal peptide comprising amino acids 61–77. Second, MGP enhances cell attachment and cell spreading on fibronectin. MGP alone does not promote cell adhesion. Third, MGP is present in fibronectin-rich regions of tissue sections. Conclusions. MGP binds to fibronectin. The presence of MGP increased cell-fibronectin interactions.",2014

The ultrasonic features of 328 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), as confirmed by pathology, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were diagnosed with PTMC if the tumor size was ≤10 mm in diameter or non-PTMC if the tumor size was >10 mm in diameter. The shape, ratio of length/width, boundary, echo, peripheral halo ring, calcification, cystic changes, blood flow, lymph node metastasis and additional accompanying thyroid diseases were compared between the patients with PTMC and non-PTMC. In total, 389 nodules were identified in the 328 patients, including 209 PTMC nodules and 180 non-PTMC nodules. The multifocality rate was 15.9% (52/328). Ultrasound scans detected a total of 371 nodules, while 18 PMTC nodules were missed diagnosed and 57 nodules were misdiagnosed as benign nodules. Statistically significant differences in the boundary, ratio of length/width, cystic changes, blood flow and lymph node metastasis were observed between the PTMC and non-PTMC groups (P<0.05). However, no statistically significant differences were observed with regard to the shape, calcification, peripheral halo rings and additional accompanying thyroid diseases between the two groups (P>0.05). Therefore, ultrasound plays an important role in the diagnosis of PTC, with PTMC and non-PTMC exhibiting different ultrasonic performances.",2014 Oct

Methods: We analyzed 1,475 malignant breast biopsies, 1,063 invasive and 412 DCIS, from 35,871 prospectively collected consecutive diagnostic mammograms interpreted at University of California, San Francisco between 1/6/1997 and 6/29/2007. We constructed three logistic regression models to predict the probability of invasive cancer versus DCIS for the following groups: women ≥ 65 (older group), women 50–64 (middle age group), and women < 50 (younger group). We identified significant predictors and measured the performance in all models using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The models for older and the middle age groups performed significantly better than the model for younger group (AUC = 0.848 vs, 0.778; p = 0.049 and AUC = 0.851 vs, 0.778; p = 0.022, respectively). Palpability and principal mammographic finding were significant predictors in distinguishing invasive from DCIS in all age groups. Family history of breast cancer, mass shape and mass margins were significant positive predictors of invasive cancer in the older group whereas calcification distribution was a negative predictor of invasive cancer (i.e. predicted DCIS). In the middle age group—mass margins, and in the younger group—mass size were positive predictors of invasive cancer. Conclusions: Clinical and mammographic finding features predict invasive breast cancer versus DCIS better in older women than younger women. Specific predictive variables differ based on age.

633,"Korosoglou G,Giusca S,Gitsioudis G,Erbel C,Katus HA",Cardiac magnetic resonance and computed tomography angiography for clinical imaging of stable coronary artery disease. Diagnostic classification and risk stratification.,"Despite advances in the pharmacologic and interventional treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD), atherosclerosis remains the leading cause of death in Western societies. X-ray coronary angiography has been the modality of choice for diagnosing the presence and extent of CAD. However, this technique is invasive and provides limited information on the composition of atherosclerotic plaque. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) have emerged as promising non-invasive techniques for the clinical imaging of CAD. Hereby, CCTA allows for visualization of coronary calcification, lumen narrowing and atherosclerotic plaque composition. In this regard, data from the CONFIRM Registry recently demonstrated that both atherosclerotic plaque burden and lumen narrowing exhibit incremental value for the prediction of future cardiac events. However, due to technical limitations with CCTA, resulting in false positive or negative results in the presence of severe calcification or motion artifacts, this technique cannot entirely replace invasive angiography at the present time. CMR on the other hand, provides accurate assessment of the myocardial function due to its high spatial and temporal resolution and intrinsic blood-to-tissue contrast. Hereby, regional wall motion and perfusion abnormalities, during dobutamine or vasodilator stress, precede the development of ST-segment depression and anginal symptoms enabling the detection of functionally significant CAD. While CT generally offers better spatial resolution, the versatility of CMR can provide information on myocardial function, perfusion, and viability, all without ionizing radiation for the patients. Technical developments with these 2 non-invasive imaging tools and their current implementation in the clinical imaging of CAD will be presented and discussed herein.",2014

Leiomyosarcoma is an extremely rare tumor that accounts for only 0.1% of all invasive renal tumors. Case presentation: A 50-year-old Japanese woman presented at a community hospital with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed a horseshoe kidney with a hypovascular tumor (size, 9 × 7 cm) showing calcification in the upper pole of the right kidney. Open right heminephrectomy and division of the isthmus were performed. Histological examination revealed alternating fascicles of spindle cells with blunt ended non-tapering nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor had high mitotic activity with a mitotic count of 8 mitoses/10 high-power fields. On the basis of these findings, we diagnosed the patient as having leiomyosarcoma.

We report a very rare case with a malignant adenomyoepithelioma combining with adenoid cystic carcinoma in a single mass. Case presentation: A 61-year-old female presented with a palpable painless mass in the right breast. Mammography revealed a large irregular dense shadow without obvious internal calcification. A simple lumpectomy was performed, and a 1.6cm well-circumscribed pale-tan nodule was presented. Histologically, the nodule was composed of two obscure lobules. One exhibited typical histological image of adenoid cystic carcinoma, the other one showed the image of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma of salivary gland, and support the diagnosis of biphasic malignant adenomyoepithelioma. Transition between the two lobules was gradual. Immunohistochemically, CK18 and P63 highlighted the epithelial and myoepithelial cells respectively in both lesions. CD117 was positive in the epithelial cells of adenoid cystic carcinoma, but was totally negative in malignant adenomyoepithelioma. Conclusion: This report is, to our knowledge, the first case that combines these two tumors in a single mass. In addition, we present a review of the literature.

636,"Tan M,Pu J,Zheng B",A new and fast image feature selection method for developing an optimal mammographic mass detection scheme.,"Purpose:: Selecting optimal features from a large image feature pool remains a major challenge in developing computer-aided detection (CAD) schemes of medical images. The objective of this study is to investigate a new approach to significantly improve efficacy of image feature selection and classifier optimization in developing a CAD scheme of mammographic masses. Methods:: An image dataset including 1600 regions of interest (ROIs) in which 800 are positive (depicting malignant masses) and 800 are negative (depicting CAD-generated false positive regions) was used in this study. After segmentation of each suspicious lesion by a multilayer topographic region growth algorithm, 271 features were computed in different feature categories including shape, texture, contrast, isodensity, spiculation, local topological features, as well as the features related to the presence and location of fat and calcifications. Besides computing features from the original images, the authors also computed new texture features from the dilated lesion segments. In order to select optimal features from this initial feature pool and build a highly performing classifier, the authors examined and compared four feature selection methods to optimize an artificial neural network (ANN) based classifier, namely: (1) Phased Searching with NEAT in a Time-Scaled Framework, (2) A sequential floating forward selection (SFFS) method, (3) A genetic algorithm (GA), and (4) A sequential forward selection (SFS) method. Performances of the four approaches were assessed using a tenfold cross validation method. Results:: Among these four methods, SFFS has highest efficacy, which takes 3%–5% of computational time as compared to GA approach, and yields the highest performance level with the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.864 ± 0.034. The results also demonstrated that except using GA, including the new texture features computed from the dilated mass segments improved the AUC results of the ANNs optimized using other three feature selection methods. In addition, among 271 features, the shape, local morphological features, fat and calcification based features were the most frequently selected features to build ANNs. Conclusions:: Although conventional GA is a powerful tool in optimizing classifiers used in CAD schemes of medical images, it is very computationally intensive. This study demonstrated that using a new SFFS based approach enabled to significantly improve efficacy of image feature selection for developing CAD schemes.",2014 Aug
637,"Fausther M,Lavoie EG,Goree JR,Baldini G,Dranoff JA",NT5E Mutations That Cause Human Disease Are Associated with Intracellular Mistrafficking of NT5E Protein.,"Ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73/NT5E, the product of the NT5E gene, is the dominant enzyme in the generation of adenosine from degradation of AMP in the extracellular environment. Nonsense (c.662C→A, p.S221X designated F1, c.1609dupA, p.V537fsX7 designated F3) and missense (c.1073G→A, p.C358Y designated F2) NT5E gene mutations in three distinct families have been shown recently to cause premature arterial calcification disease in human patients. However, the underlying mechanisms by which loss-of-function NT5E mutations cause human disease are unknown. We hypothesized that human NT5E gene mutations cause mistrafficking of the defective proteins within cells, ultimately blocking NT5E catalytic function. To test this hypothesis, plasmids encoding cDNAs of wild type and mutant human NT5E tagged with the fluorescent probe DsRed were generated and used for transfection and heterologous expression in immortalized monkey COS-7 kidney cells that lack native NT5E protein. Enzyme histochemistry and Malachite green assays were performed to assess the biochemical activities of wild type and mutant fusion NT5E proteins. Subcellular trafficking of fusion NT5E proteins was monitored by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis of fractionated cell constituents. All 3 F1, F2, and F3 mutations result in a protein with significantly reduced trafficking to the plasma membrane and reduced ER retention as compared to wild type protein. Confocal immunofluorescence demonstrates vesicles containing DsRed-tagged NT5E proteins (F1, F2 and F3) in the cell synthetic apparatus. All 3 mutations resulted in absent NT5E enzymatic activity at the cell surface. In conclusion, three familial NT5E mutations (F1, F2, F3) result in novel trafficking defects associated with human disease. These novel genetic causes of human disease suggest that the syndrome of premature arterial calcification due to NT5E mutations may also involve a novel “trafficking-opathy”.",2014

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 18 patients (five males, 13 females; median age 56 years) with pathologically confirmed intrathymic cysts who underwent thymectomy and had preoperative chest computed tomography (CT) available for review. The patient demographics, clinical presentation, and preoperative radiological diagnoses were reviewed. CT images were evaluated for shape, contour, location of the cysts and the presence of adjacent thymic tissue, mass effect, calcifications, and septa. The size and CT attenuations of the cysts were measured. RESULTS: The most common CT features of intrathymic cysts included oval shape (9/18; 50%), smooth contour (12/18; 67%), midline location (11/18; 61%), the absence of visible adjacent thymic tissue (12/18; 67%), and the absence of calcification (16/18; 89%). The mean longest diameter and the longest perpendicular diameter were 25 mm (range 17–49 mm) and 19 mm (range 10–44 mm), respectively. The mean CT attenuation was 38 HU (range 6–62 HU) on contrast-enhanced CT, and was 45 HU (range 26–64 HU) on unenhanced CT (p=0.41). The CT attenuation was >20 HU in 15 of 18 patients (83%). Preoperative radiological diagnosis included thymoma in 11 patients. CONCLUSION: In surgically removed, pathologically proven cases of intrathymic cyst, the CT attenuation was >20 HU in most cases, leading to the preoperative diagnosis of thymoma. Awareness of the spectrum of imaging findings of the entity is essential to improve the diagnostic accuracy and patient management.",2014 Jul
639,"El Asmar MS,Naoum JJ,Arbid EJ",Vitamin K Dependent Proteins and the Role of Vitamin K2 in the Modulation of Vascular Calcification: A Review.,"Vascular calcification, a cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, is an actively regulated process involving vitamin K dependent proteins (VKDPs) among others. Vitamin K is an essential micronutrient, present in plants and animal fermented products that plays an important role as a cofactor for the post-translational γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in a number of proteins. These VKDPs require carboxylation to become biologically active, and they have been identified as having an active role in vascular cell migration, angiogenesis and vascular calcification. This paper will review the process of vascular calcification and delineate the role that vitamin K2 plays in the modulation of that process, through the activation of VKDPs. One such VKDP is Matrix Gla Protein (MGP), which when activated inhibits osteogenic factors, thereby inhibiting vascular and soft tissue calcification.",2014 May

Individuals born with bicuspid aortic valves, 1–2% of the population, are at the highest risk of developing aortic valve calcification. Aortic valve calcification involves increased expression of calcification and inflammatory genes. Bicuspid aortic valve leaflets experience increased biomechanical strain as compared to normal tricuspid aortic valves. The molecular pathogenesis involved in the calcification of BAVs are not well understood, especially the molecular response to mechanical stretch. HOTAIR is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that has been implicated with cancer but has not been studied in cardiac disease. We have found that HOTAIR levels are decreased in BAVs and in human aortic interstitial cells (AVICs) exposed to cyclic stretch. Reducing HOTAIR levels via siRNA in AVICs results in increased expression of calcification genes. Our data suggest that β-CATENIN is a stretch responsive signaling pathway that represses HOTAIR. This is the first report demonstrating that HOTAIR is mechanoresponsive and repressed by WNT β-CATENIN signaling. These findings provide novel evidence that HOTAIR is involved in aortic valve calcification.",2014
641,"Hosen MJ,Coucke PJ,Le Saux O,De Paepe A,Vanakker OM",Perturbation of specific pro-mineralizing signalling pathways in human and murine pseudoxanthoma elasticum.,"Background: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is characterized by skin (papular lesions), ocular (subretinal neovascularisation) and cardiovascular manifestations (peripheral artery disease), due to mineralization and fragmentation of elastic fibres in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene, the mechanisms underlying this disease remain unknown. The knowledge on the molecular background of soft tissue mineralization largely comes from insights in vascular calcification, with involvement of the osteoinductive Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) family (TGFβ1-3 and Bone Morphogenetic Proteins [BMP]), together with ectonucleotides (ENPP1), Wnt signalling and a variety of local and systemic calcification inhibitors. In this study, we have investigated the relevance of the signalling pathways described in vascular soft tissue mineralization in the PXE knock-out mouse model and in PXE patients. Methods: The role of the pro-osteogenic pathways BMP2-SMADs-RUNX2, TGFβ-SMAD2/3 and Wnt-MSX2, apoptosis and ER stress was evaluated using immunohistochemistry, mRNA expression profiling and immune-co-staining in dermal tissues and fibroblast cultures of PXE patients and the eyes and whiskers of the PXE knock-out mouse. Apoptosis was further evaluated by TUNEL staining and siRNA mediated gene knockdown. ALPL activity in PXE fibroblasts was studied using ALPL stains. Results: We demonstrate the upregulation of the BMP2-SMADs-RUNX2 and TGFβ-2-SMAD2/3 pathway, co-localizing with the mineralization sites, and the involvement of MSX2-canonical Wnt signalling. Further, we show that apoptosis is also involved in PXE with activation of Caspases and BCL-2. In contrast to vascular calcification, neither the other BMPs and TGFβs nor endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways seem to be perturbed in PXE. Conclusions: Our study shows that we cannot simply extrapolate knowledge on cell signalling in vascular soft tissue calcification to a multisystem ectopic mineralisation disease as PXE. Contrary, we demonstrate a specific set of perturbed signalling pathways in PXE patients and the knock-out mouse model. Based on our findings and previously reported data, we propose a preliminary cell model of ECM calcification in PXE.",2014

Analysis by Age, Gender and Coronary Risk Factors.","Aims: To investigate the value of coronary calcium scoring (CCS) as a filter scan prior to coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Methods and Results: Between February 2008 and April 2011, 732 consecutive patients underwent clinically indicated CCTA. During this ‘control phase’, CCS was performed in all patients. In patients with CCS≥800, CCTA was not performed. During a subsequent ‘CCTA phase’ (May 2011–May 2012) another 200 consecutive patients underwent CCTA, and CCS was performed only in patients with increased probability for severe calcification according to age, gender and atherogenic risk factors. In patients where CCS was not performed, calcium scoring was performed in contrast-enhanced CCTA images. Significant associations were noted between CCS and age (r = 0.30, p<0.001) and coronary risk factors (χ2 = 37.9; HR = 2.2; 95%CI = 1.7–2.9, p<0.001). Based on these associations, a ≤3% pre-test probability for CCS≥800 was observed for males <61 yrs. and females <79 yrs. According to these criteria, CCS was not performed in 106 of 200 (53%) patients during the ‘CCTA phase’, including 47 (42%) males and 59 (67%) females. This resulted in absolute radiation saving of ∼1 mSv in 75% of patients younger than 60 yrs. Of 106 patients where CCS was not performed, estimated calcium scoring was indeed <800 in 101 (95%) cases. Non-diagnostic image quality due to calcification was similar between the ‘control phase’ and the ‘CCTA’ group (0.25% versus 0.40%, p = NS). Conclusion: The value of CCS as a filter for identification of a high calcium score is limited in younger patients with intermediate risk profile. Omitting CCS in such patients can contribute to further dose reduction with cardiac CT studies.",2014

The aim of this review is to discuss relevant literature examining relation between BAC and atherosclerosis. After a thorough literature search, in OVID and PubMed, 199 studies were identified, of which 25 were relevant to our review. Data were abstracted from each study and statistical analysis was done, including calculation of odds ratios and construction of forest plots. A total of 35,542 patients were enrolled across 25 studies looking at an association between BAC and coronary artery disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke, cerebral artery disease, carotid and peripheral artery diseases, and coronary artery calcification. A majority of the studies showed a statistically significant relation between BAC and presence of coronary artery disease cardiovascular disease and associated mortality. Sensitivity of BAC in predicting cardiovascular events was low, but specificity was high. BAC was predictive of incident and prevalent stroke but not mortality of stroke. Similarly, BAC was predictive of cerebral, carotid, and peripheral artery diseases. The role of BAC as a surrogate marker of coronary and systemic atherosclerosis is currently uncertain. Its role may be further elucidated by more large-scale prospective studies and clinical experience.",2014 Mar-Apr

This study aimed to investigate whether presence and severity of breast artery calcification (BAC) on mammograms is associated with computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) finding such as coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and the severity of coronary artery stenosis. Materials and Methods:: This cross-sectional study was performed on 150 women aged >40 years who were referred for CTCA. Women who had undergone screening mammography during the first year after CTCA entered the study. CAC score was determined and the severity of coronary artery stenosis was classified into normal, non-significant stenosis, or significant stenosis. Based on the severity of BAC, patients were also grouped into normal, mild, moderate, or severe groups. Then, the correlation between BAC severity and CAC score was determined. Patients with different BAC severity were also compared regarding the relative frequency of different grades of coronary artery stenosis. Results:: Mean age of subjects with BAC (n: 35) was significantly higher than patients without BAC (n: 115) (68.03 ± 6.16 versus 54.36 ± 7.63 years, P < 0.0001). Although the relative frequency of different grades of coronary artery stenosis was significantly higher in women with BAC (P < 0.0001), after controlling for age, there was no significant difference between patients with different severity of BAC in the mean of CAC score (P: 0.09). In addition, the correlation between BAC severity and CAC score was not statistically significant (R: 0.09, P: 0.26). Conclusion:: We concluded that presence and severity of BAC have no significant correlation with CAC score on CTCA.",2014

Methods:: A total of 75 patients who had synchronous lesions with pathologic confirmation at the initial diagnosis of breast cancer during January 2007 and December 2007 were included. The clinical factors of the patients were evaluated. One observer retrospectively reviewed the imaging studies of the index breast cancer lesion and the synchronous lesion. The PPV for additional biopsy was calculated for BWBU and various clinical and imaging factors affecting the PPV for BWBU were evaluated. Results:: The overall PPV for additional biopsy was 25.7% (18 of 70). The PPV for synchronous lesions detected both on mammography and BWBU, and detected only on BWBU, was 76.9% (10 of 13) and 14.3% (7 of 49), respectively. There was no clinical factor affecting the PPV for BWBU. Among the imaging factors, ipsilateral location of the synchronous lesion to the index lesion (P=0.06) showed a marginal statistically significant correlation with malignancy in the synchronous breast lesion. A mass with calcification on mammography presentation (P<0.01), presence of calcification among the ultrasonography findings (P<0.01), and high Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System final assessment (P<0.01) were imaging factors that were associated with malignancy in the additional synchronous lesion.

Methods: The clinical data of 379 patients with PTMC who underwent thyroidectomy between January and December 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. PTMC lesions were classified into four subgroups according to their calcification patterns on preoperative NUS: microcalcification, macrocalcification, rim calcification, and noncalcification. The clinicopathologic characteristics were compared between the patients with and without calcification, and among the four subgroups. Results: Calcifications were detected on NUS in 203 patients (53.5%) and central neck node metastasis was observed in 119 patients (31.3%). Calcification was associated with larger tumor size (0.68 cm vs. 0.54 cm), higher rate of lymph node metastasis (38.6% vs. 23.2%) and higher lymph node ratio (0.11 vs. 0.06) compared to noncalcification (All P < 0.05). In addition, the extent of calcification correlated with lesion size (0.67 cm vs. 0.69 cm vs. 0.85 cm). Further, the likelihood of lymph node metastasis also correlated with the extent of calcification in the order of non-, micro- and macrocalcification (23.3%, 36.8%, and 44.1%, respectively). The calcification rate was higher in patients with lymph node metastasis than those without it (65.5% vs.47.7%) (All P < 0.05). Conclusion: PTMC patients positive for calcification on NUS had a higher rate of lymph node metastasis, and a higher lymph node ratio compared to noncalcification patients. Calcification patterns should be assessed carefully in patients with PTMC by preoperative NUS.",2014 Mar

The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between serum HIF-1α with coronary artery calcification (CAC) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: The subjects were 405 (262 males, 143 females, age 51.3 ± 6.4 years) asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Serum HIF-1α and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured by ELISA. CAC scores were assessed by a 320-slice CT scanner. The subjects were divided into 4 quartiles depending on serum HIF-1α levels. Results: Average serum HIF-1α was 184.4 ± 66.7 pg/ml. Among patients with higher CAC scores, HIF-1α levels were also significantly increased (p <0.001). HIF-1α levels positively correlated with CRP, IL-6, UKPDS risk score, HbA1c, FBG, and CACS, but did not correlate with diabetes duration, age, and LDL. According to the multivariate analysis, HIF-1α levels significantly and independently predict the presence of CAC. ROC curve analysis showed that the serum HIF-1α level can predict the extent of CAC, but the specificity was lower than the traditional risk factors UKPDS and HbA1c. Conclusion: As a marker of hypoxia, serum HIF-1α level may be an independent risk factor for the presence of CAC. These findings indicate that elevated serum HIF-1α may be involved in vascular calcification in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",2014

The purpose was to evaluate the sonographic subtype-pathologic correlation, and to identify the effectiveness of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)-ultrasound (US) for differentiation of benign and malignant CBLs. Material and methods: A database from December 1, 2007 and November 30, 2009 was identified in the Department of Diagnostic Ultrasound, Rui Jin Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. Those patients with palpable or clinical symptomatic breast masses were associated with a cystic component in lesions on breast US. All patients underwent a subsequent fine-needle/core-needle biopsy or surgical excision. The sonographic findings were analyzed according to the BI-RADS-US, and were categorized by two different methods of subtype categorization compared with the pathologic results. Results: Ninety-nine breast cystic lesions in 83 women were included, among whom 16 patients were identified with bilateral cystic lesions. The total malignancy rate of CBLs was 14.1% (95% confidence interval 7.3–21.0%). Among 99 CBLs, 14 malignant lesions were associated with sonographic appearances of complex cystic lesions, while the remaining subtypes were benign. Shape, margin, echo pattern, orientation, calcification, and vascularity were statistically significantly different between the benign and malignant lesions (p = 0.010, p = 0.004, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.036, and p < 0.001, respectively) (degrees of freedom = 1). Conclusions: By comparison of the two different methods of subtype categorization of CBLs, the appropriate 5-variety classification should be suggested. The BI-RADS-US was useful for differentiating benign from malignant cystic lesions.",2014 Feb 24

Our physiopathological assumption is that u-PA, t-PA, and PAI-1 are released by calcified aortic valves and play a role in the calcification of these valves. Methods. Sixty-five calcified aortic valves were collected from patients suffering from aortic stenosis. Each valve was incubated for 24 hours in culture medium. The supernatants were used to measure u-PA, t-PA, and PAI-1 concentrations; the valve calcification was evaluated using biphotonic absorptiometry. Results. Aortic stenosis valves expressed normal plasminogen activators concentrations and overexpressed PAI-1 (u-PA, t-PA, and PAI-1 mean concentrations were, resp., 1.69 ng/mL ± 0.80, 2.76 ng/mL ± 1.33, and 53.27 ng/mL ± 36.39). There was no correlation between u-PA and PAI-1 (r = 0.3) but t-PA and PAI-1 were strongly correlated with each other (r = 0.6). Overexpression of PAI-1 was proportional to the calcium content of the AS valves. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate a consistent increase of PAI-1 proportional to the calcification. The overexpression of PAI-1 may be useful as a predictive indicator in patients with aortic stenosis.",2014

In the present study, a case of synchronous ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast and follicular lymphoma is reported. During an annual breast screening procedure, a 49-year-old female presented with a hard induration under the nipple of the right breast and swelling of a soft lymph node (LN) in the right axilla. Mammography and ultrasonography revealed two lesions in the right breast: One was a tumor with microcalcification, 1.0 cm in diameter, and the other was a large, crude calcification, 2.5 cm in diameter. In addition, computed tomography and positron emission tomography revealed swellings of the bilateral axillary (Ax) LN and intra-abdominal para-aortic LN. The patient underwent excisions of the large calcified mass, a micro-calcified tumor and the right AxLN. The pathological and immunohistochemical studies revealed fat necrosis and DCIS of the breast, which was positive for the estrogen receptor and the progesterone receptor, while human epidermal growth factor receptor II protein expression was evaluated as 2+ and stage was classified as pTis pN0 M0, stage 0. Furthermore, the Ax node was diagnosed as follicular lymphoma, which was positive for cluster of differentiation (CD)20, CD79a, CD10 and B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 protein, but negative for Bcl-6 protein. The clinical stage was classified as stage III. The patient was administered chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy to the conserved breast. Two years have passed since the surgery, and the patient is disease-free.",2014 Apr

Methods: 187 patients with malignant mammographic calcifications were followed to record the appearances and changes in the calcifications and to analyze their responses to NACT. Results: Patients with calcifications had higher rates of hormonal receptor (HR) positive tumors (74.3% versus 64.6%) and HER2 positive tumors (51.3% versus 33.4%, p = 0.004) and a similar pathologic complete response (pCR) rate compared to patients without calcifications (35.4% versus 29.8%). After NACT, the range of calcification decreased in 40% of patients, increased in 7.5% and remained stable in 52.5%; the calcification density decreased in 15% of patients, increased in 7.5% and remained stable in 77.5%; none of these change patterns were related to tumor response rate. No significant correlation was observed between the calcification appearance (morphology, distribution, range, diameter or density) and tumor subtypes or pCR rates. Among patients with malignant calcifications, 54 showed calcifications alone, 40 occurred with an architectural distortion (AD) and 93 with a mass. Calcifications were observed inside the tumor in 44% of patients and outside in 56%, with similar pCR rates and patterns of change. Conclusions: Calcification appearance did not clearly change after NACT, and calcification patterns were not related to pCR rate, suggesting that mammogram may not accurate to evaluate tumor response changes. Microcalcifications visible after NACT is essential for determining the extent of excision, patients with calcifications that occurred outside of the mass still had the opportunity for breast conservation.",2014
653,"Wang W,Li C,Pang L,Shi C,Guo F,Chen A,Cao X,Wan M",Mesenchymal Stem Cells Recruited by Active TGFβ Contribute to Osteogenic Vascular Calcification.,"Vascular calcification is an actively regulated process that culminates in organized extracellular matrix mineral deposition by osteoblast-like cells. The origins of the osteoblastic cells involved in this process and the underlying mechanisms remain to be defined. We previously revealed that active transforming growth factor (TGFβ) released from the injured arteries mobilizes mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the blood stream and recruits the cells to the injured vessels for neointima formation. In this study, we used a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-deficient mouse model (ldlr−/−), which develop progressive arterial calcification after having fed high-fat western diets (HFD), to examine whether TGFβ is involved in the mobilization of MSCs during vascular calcification. Nestin+/Sca1+ cells were recruited to the diseased aorta at earlier time points, and osteocalcin+ osteoblasts and the aortic calcification were seen at later time point in these mice. Importantly, we generated parabiotic pairs with shared blood circulation by crossing ldlr−/−mice fed HFD with transgenic mice, in which all the MSC-derived cells were fluorescently labeled. The labeled cells were detected not only in the peripheral blood but also in the arterial lesions in ldlr−/− mouse partners, and these blood circulation-originated cells gave rise to Ocn+ osteoblastic cells at the arterial lesions. Both active TGFβ1 levels and MSCs in circulating blood were upregulated at the same time points when these cells appeared at the aortic tissue. Further, conditioned medium prepared by incubating the aortae from ldlr−/−mice fed HFD stimulated the migration of MSCs in the ex vivo transwell assays, and either TGFβ neutralizing antibody or the inhibitor of TGFβ Receptor I kinase (TβRI) antagonized this effect. Importantly, treatment of the mice with TβRI inhibitor blocked elevated blood MSC numbers and their recruitment to the arterial lesions. These findings suggest that TGFβ-recruited MSCs to the diseased vasculature contribute to the development of osteogenic vascular calcification.",2014 Jun 15

In this pilot study, we investigated if systemic and intraplaque levels of calcification biomarkers were affected by treatment with a statin in a cohort of patients with severe carotid stenosis and being asymptomatic for ischemic stroke. Patients on statin therapy had reduced serum osteopontin (OPN), RANKL/osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio, and MMP-9/pro-MMP-9 activity as compared to untreated patients. Statin-treated patients exhibited increased levels of collagen and reduced neutrophil infiltration in downstream portions of carotid plaques as compared to untreated controls. In upstream plaque portions, OPG content was increased in statin-treated patients as compared to controls. Other histological parameters (such as lipid, macrophage, smooth muscle cell, and MMP-9 content) as well as RANKL, RANK, and OPG mRNA levels did not differ between the two patient groups. Serum RANKL/OPG ratio positively correlated with serum levels of neutrophilic products, intraplaque neutrophil, and MMP-9 content within downstream portions of carotid plaques. In conclusion, statin treatment was associated with improvement in serum RANKL levels and reduced neutrophil activity both systemically and in atherosclerotic plaques.",2014

As CKD progresses, the ability to compensate for elevations in parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor-23 and for decreases in 1,25(OH)2D3 becomes inadequate, which results in hyperphosphatemia, abnormal bone disorders, and extra-skeletal calcification. In addition to its calciotropic effect on the regulation of calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone, vitamin D has many other noncalciotropic effects, including controlling cell differentiation/proliferation and having immunomodulatory effects. There are several immune dysregulations that can be noted when renal function declines. Physicians need to know well both the classical and nonclassical functions of vitamin D. This review is an analysis from the nephrologist's viewpoint and focuses on the relationship between the vitamin D and the immune system, together with vitamin's clinical use to treat kidney diseases.",2014

The DBT volumes were reconstructed with MSBF-regularized simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) that was designed to enhance MCs and reduce background noise while preserving the quality of other tissue structures. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of MCs was further improved with enhancement-modulated calcification response (EMCR) preprocessing, which combined multiscale Hessian response to enhance MCs by shape and bandpass filtering to remove the low-frequency structured background. MC candidates were then located in the EMCR volume using iterative thresholding and segmented by adaptive region growing. Two sets of potential MC objects, cluster centroid objects and MC seed objects, were generated and the CNR of each object was calculated. The number of candidates in each set was controlled based on the breast volume. Dynamic clustering around the centroid objects grouped the MC candidates to form clusters. Adaptive criteria were designed to reduce false positive (FP) clusters based on the size, CNR values and the number of MCs in the cluster, cluster shape, and cluster based maximum intensity projection. Free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) and jackknife alternative FROC (JAFROC) analyses were used to assess the performance and compare with that of a previous study.Results: Unpaired two-tailed t-test showed a significant increase (p < 0.0001) in the ratio of CNRs for MCs with and without MSBF regularization compared to similar ratios for FPs. For view-based detection, a sensitivity of 85% was achieved at an FP rate of 2.16 per DBT volume. For case-based detection, a sensitivity of 85% was achieved at an FP rate of 0.85 per DBT volume. JAFROC analysis showed a significant improvement in the performance of the current CADe system compared to that of our previous system (p = 0.003).Conclusions: MBSF regularized SART reconstruction enhances MCs. The enhancement in the signals, in combination with properly designed adaptive threshold criteria, effective MC feature analysis, and false positive reduction techniques, leads to a significant improvement in the detection of clustered MCs in DBT.",2014 Feb

661,"Liu WC,Yen JF,Lang CL,Yan MT,Lu KC",Bisphophonates in CKD Patients with Low Bone Mineral Density.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) have a high risk of bone fracture because of low bone mineral density and poor bone quality. Osteoporosis also features low bone mass, disarranged microarchitecture, and skeletal fragility, and differentiating between osteoporosis and CKD-MBD in low bone mineral density is a challenge and usually achieved by bone biopsy. Bisphosphonates can be safe and beneficial for patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 30 mL/min or higher, but prescribing bisphosphonates in advanced CKD requires caution because of the increased possibility of low bone turnover disorders such as osteomalacia, mixed uremic osteodystrophy, and adynamic bone, even aggravating hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, bone biopsy in advanced CKD is an important consideration before prescribing bisphosphonates. Treatment also may induce hypocalcemia in CKD patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, but vitamin D supplementation may ameliorate this effect. Bisphosphonate treatment can improve both bone mineral density and vascular calcification, but the latter becomes more unlikely in patients with stage 3-4 CKD with vascular calcification but no decreased bone mineral density. Using bisphosphonates requires considerable caution in advanced CKD, and the lack of adequate clinical investigation necessitates more studies regarding its effects on these patients.",2013

Cadherin-11 (cad-11) is a cell-cell adhesion protein classically expressed at mesenchymal-osteoblast interfaces and it participates in mesenchymal differentiation to osteochondral-lineages. This suggests cad-11 may have an important role in heart valve development and pathogenesis, but its expression patterns in valves are largely unknown. In this study, we profiled the spatial and temporal expression patterns of cad-11 in embryonic chick and mouse heart development. We determined that cad-11 is expressed in both endocardial and mesenchymal cells of the atrioventricular (AV) and outflow tract (OFT) cushions (Pre HH30/E14), but becomes restricted to the valve endocardial/endothelial cells during late fetal remodeling and throughout postnatal life. We then investigated changes in Cad-11 expression in a murine aortic valve disease model (the ApoE−/−). Unlike wildtype mice, cad-11 becomes dramatically re-expressed in the interstitium. Similarly, in calcified human aortic valve leaflets, cad-11 loses endothelial confinement and becomes significantly re-expressed in the valve interstitium. Double labeling identified that 91% of myofibroblastic and 96% of osteoblastic cells in calcified aortic valves were also cad-11 positive. Collectively, our results suggest that cad-11 is important for proper embryonic cushion formation and remodeling, but may also participate in aortic valve pathogenesis if re-expressed in adulthood.",2013

Studies investigating the association between phylloquinone intake and risk of stroke are scarce, and the relation with menaquinones has not been investigated to date. Methods and Results: We investigated the association between intake of phylloquinone and menaquinones and stroke in a prospective cohort of 35 476 healthy subjects. Information on occurrence of stroke was obtained by linkage to national registries, and stroke was further specified into ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Vitamin K intake was estimated using a validated food‐frequency questionnaire. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle, and other dietary factors were used to estimate the associations. During a follow‐up of 12.1±2.1 years, 580 incident cases of stroke were identified, 163 of which were hemorrhagic and 324 were ischemic. Phylloquinone intake was not associated with risk of stroke with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.09 (95% CI: 0.85 to 1.40, Ptrend 0.41) for the highest versus lowest quartile. For intake of menaquinones similar results were found, with an HRQ4 versus Q1 of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.75 to 1.29, Ptrend 0.82).

Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: Community. Patients: 286 postmenopausal women with individual measurements of famine exposure during childhood in the Netherlands during World War II. Intervention/exposure: Famine exposure during childhood. Main outcome measures: Coronary artery calcifications measured by CT scan and scored using the Agatston method; calcifications of the aorta and cardiac valves (mitral and/or aortic) measured semiquantitatively. Logistic regression was used for coronary Agatston score of >100 or ≤100, valve or aortic calcifications as the dependent variable and an indicator for famine exposure as the independent variable. These models were also used for confounder adjustment and stratification based on age groups of 0–9 and 10–17 years. Results: In the overall analysis, no statistically significant association was found between severe famine exposure in childhood and a high coronary calcium score (OR 1.80, 95% CI 0.87 to 3.78). However, when looking at specific risk periods, severe famine exposure during adolescence was related to a higher risk for a high coronary calcium score than non-exposure to famine, both in crude (OR 3.47, 95% CI 1.00 to 12.07) and adjusted analyses (OR 4.62, 95% CI 1.16 to 18.43). No statistically significant association was found between childhood famine exposure and valve or aortic calcification (OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.69 to 4.10). Conclusions: Famine exposure in childhood, especially during adolescence, seems to be associated with a higher risk of coronary artery calcification in late adulthood. However, the association between childhood famine exposure and cardiac valve/aortic calcification is less clear.",2013

Senescent VSMCs have been shown to be present in atherosclerotic plaques. Both replicative (RS) and stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) accompany cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to establish the signature of RS and SIPS of VSMCs, induced by a common anticancer drug, doxorubicin, and to discover the so far undisclosed features of senescent cells that are potentially harmful to the organism. Most of the senescence hallmarks were common for both RS and SIPS; however, some differences were observed. 32 % of doxorubicin-treated cells were arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, while 73 % of replicatively senescing cells were arrested in the G1 phase. Moreover, on the basis of alkaline phosphatase activity measurements, we show that a 7-day treatment with doxorubicin (dox), does not cause precocious cell calcification, which is a characteristic feature of RS. We did not observe calcification even though after 7 days of dox-treatment many other markers characteristic for senescent cells were present. It can suggest that dox-induced SIPS does not accelerate the mineralization of vessels. We consider that detailed characterization of the two types of cellular senescence can be useful in in vitro studies of potential anti-aging factors.Electronic supplementary material: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10522-013-9477-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",2014

A menaquinone form of vitamin K, MK4, is increasingly recognized for its key roles in mitochondrial electron transport, as a ligand for the nuclear receptor SXR, which controls expression of genes involved in transport and metabolism of endo- and xenobiotics, and as a pharmacotherapeutic in the treatment of osteoporosis. Although cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4F2 activity is recognized as an important determinant of phylloquinone (K1) metabolism, the enzymes involved in menaquinone catabolism have not been studied previously. CYP4F2 and CYP4F11 were expressed and purified and found to be equally efficient as in vitro catalysts of MK4 ω-hydroxylation. CYP4F2, but not CYP4F11, catalyzed sequential metabolism of MK4 to the ω-acid without apparent release of the intermediate aldehyde. The ω-alcohol could also be metabolized to the acid by microsomal NAD+-dependent alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases. LC-MS/MS analysis of trypsinized human liver microsomes (using surrogate peptide approach) revealed mean concentrations of CYP4F2 and CYP4F11 to be 14.3 and 8.4 pmol/mg protein, respectively. Microsomal MK4 ω-hydroxylation activities correlated with the CYP4F2 V433M genotype but not CYP4F11 D446N genotype. Collectively, these data expand the lexicon of vitamin K ω-hydroxylases to include the ‘orphan’ P450 CYP4F11 and identify a common variant, CYP4F2 (rs2108622), as a major pharmacogenetic variable influencing MK4 catabolism.",2013 Nov 19
669,"Galeone A,Paparella D,Colucci S,Grano M,Brunetti G",The Role of TNF-α and TNF Superfamily Members in the Pathogenesis of Calcific Aortic Valvular Disease.,"Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) represents a slowly progressive pathologic process associated with major morbidity and mortality. The process is characterized by multiple steps: inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification. Numerous studies focalized on its physiopathology highlighting different “actors” for the multiple “acts.” This paper focuses on the role of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF) members in the pathogenesis of CAVD. In particular, we discuss the clinical and experimental studies providing evidence of the involvement of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL), its membrane receptor RANK and its decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG), and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in valvular calcification.",2013

Sclerostin, an endogenous regulator of the Wnt pathway and bone formation, has been associated with impaired osteoblast activation and may play a role in vascular calcification. Objective:: Our objective was to assess the relationships between sclerostin, BMD, and CP. Design:: Generalized linear models were fitted to test for associations between sclerostin, volumetric BMD (vBMD), and CP. Participants:: A targeted population of 450 unrelated African Americans (AAs) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) was 56% female with mean/SD/median age of 55.4/9.5/55.0 years and a diabetes duration of 10.3/8.2/8.0 years. Main Outcome Measures:: Plasma sclerostin, computed tomography-derived thoracic and lumbar vertebrae trabecular vBMD, coronary artery, carotid artery, and aortoiliac CP were measured. Results:: Plasma sclerostin was 1119/401/1040 pg/mL, thoracic vBMD was 206.3/52.4/204.8 mg/cm3, lumbar vBMD was 180.7/47.0/179.0 mg/cm3, coronary artery CP score was 284/648/13, carotid artery CP score was 46/132/0, and aortoiliac CP score was 1613/2910/282. Sclerostin levels were higher in men than women (P < .0001). Before and after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking, hemoglobin A1c, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, plasma sclerostin levels were positively associated with thoracic and lumbar vertebrae vBMD (P < .0001). Sex-stratified analyses verified significant relationships in both men and women (both P < .001). Sclerostin was not associated with CP except for an inverse relationship with carotid CP in men (fully adjusted model, P = .03). Conclusions:: In this cross-sectional study of AA men and women with T2D, circulating sclerostin was positively associated with vBMD in the spine in both sexes and inversely associated with carotid artery CP in men. Sclerostin may play a role in skeletal mineral metabolism in AA but fails to explain inverse relationships between BMD and CP.",2014 Jan

Here, we isolated MSC from adult tissues—bone marrow (BM-MSC), dental tissue (DT-MSC), and adipose tissue (AT-MSC)—to compare how autotransplantation of these MSC effectively supports the repair of bone fracture and ischemic tissue. An analysis by in vitro differentiation assays showed no significant difference among these MSC. The degree of calcification at the joint region of bone fracture was higher in mice transplanted with AT-MSC than in mice transplanted with BM-MSC or DT-MSC. To compare the abilities of MSC, characterize how those MSC affect the repair of ischemic tissue, vascular occlusion was performed by ligation of the femoral artery and vein. Of note, the blood flow in the ischemic region rapidly increased in mice injected with AT-MSC, as contrasted with mice injected with BM- or DT-MSC. The number of CD45- and F4/80-positive cells at the femoral region was higher in AT-MSC recipients than in recipients of BM-MSC or DT-MSC. We evaluated the mRNA expression of angiogenic and migration factors in MSC and found the expression of CCL5 mRNA was higher in AT-MSC than in BM-MSC or DT-MSC. Transplantation of AT-MSC with impaired expression of CCL5 clearly showed a significant delay in the recovery of blood flow compared with the control. These findings have fundamental implications for the modulation of AT-MSC in the repair of vasculature and bone fracture.",2014 Mar 01
672,"Xiao F,Liu D,Guo Y,Shi B,Song Z,Tian Y,Liang C",Novel and Convenient Method to Evaluate the Character of Solitary Pulmonary Nodule-Comparison of Three Mathematical Prediction Models and Further Stratification of Risk Factors.,"Objective: To study risk factors that affect the evaluation of malignancy in patients with solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) and verify different predictive models for malignant probability of SPN. Methods: Retrospectively analyzed 107 cases of SPN with definite post-operative histological diagnosis whom underwent surgical procedures in China-Japan Friendship Hospital from November of 2010 to February of 2013. Age, gender, smoking history, malignancy history of patients, imaging features of the nodule including maximum diameter, position, spiculation, lobulation, calcification and serum level of CEA and Cyfra21-1 were assessed as potential risk factors. Univariate analysis model was used to establish statistical correlation between risk factors and post-operative histological diagnosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn using different predictive models for malignant probability of SPN to get areas under the curves (AUC values), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values for each model, respectively. The predictive effectiveness of each model was statistically assessed subsequently. Results: In 107 patients, 78 cases were malignant (72.9%), 29 cases were benign (27.1%). Statistical significant difference was found between benign and malignant group in age, maximum diameter, serum level of Cyfra21-1, spiculation, lobulation and calcification of the nodules. The AUC values were 0.786±0.053 (Mayo model), 0.682±0.060 (VA model) and 0.810±0.051 (Peking University People’s Hospital model), respectively. Conclusions: Serum level of Cyfra21-1, patient’s age, maximum diameter of the nodule, spiculation, lobulation and calcification of the nodule are independent risk factors associated with the malignant probability of SPN. Peking University People’s Hospital model is of high accuracy and clinical value for patients with SPN. Adding serum index (e.g. Cyfra21-1) into the prediction models as a new risk factor and adjusting the weight of age in the models might improve the accuracy of prediction for SPN.",2013

The patient was a 33-year-old woman with a long history of stage IIIc ovarian cancer who had undergone transabdominal hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy followed by chemotherapy with gemcitabine hydrochloride. Incidentally, computed tomography (CT) revealed a cerebellar tumor with calcification. The size of the tumor gradually increased, and lateral suboccipital craniotomy was performed for gross total removal of the tumor. The histological diagnosis was ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged two days after surgery. Brain metastases from ovarian cancer are rare. In the review of metastatic brain tumors arising from a primary ovarian cancer in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at our institution, this phenomenon was noted in only 10 cases (0.24%) of 4,158 patients with ovarian cancer seen at our center over a period of 8 years. Moreover, only three cases of calcified metastatic brain tumor have been reported previously. In conclusion, complete tumor resection may be an acceptable approach for patients with calcified metastatic tumors both for therapeutic considerations and to obtain tissue for confirmation of histopathological diagnosis. Metastatic brain tumors can be calcified, and should be considered within the differential diagnosis of calcified intracranial lesions to avoid any delay in diagnosis or treatment.",2013 Oct

Systemic screening by computed tomography (CT) examination detected a 20 mm nodule with calcification in the thyroid, multiple well circumscribed nodules in bilateral lung filed, and a bone metastasis to the right dorsal rib. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a hypervascular mass fed from anterior and posterior choroidal arteries. Tumor biopsy via parietal transcortical approach confirmed a thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the choroid plexus. Of the 33 reported cases of choroid plexus metastasis, 14 (42%) are from kidney and 3 (9%) from thyroid cancer, which appears to be overrepresented considering their prevalence among all brain metastasis.

675,"Bitton RR,Pauly KRB",MR-ARFI and SWI to Visualize Calcifications in Ex-Vivo Swine Brain.,"Purpose: To present the use of MR – Acoustic Radiation Force Imaging (MR-ARFI) and Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI) to visualize calcifications in ex vivo brain tissue as a planning indicator for MR guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS). Materials and Methods: Calcifications were implanted in ex vivo swine brain and imaged using SWI, MR-ARFI, and Computed Tomography (CT). SWI filtered phase images used a 3D gradient recalled echo (GRE) images with a Fourier-based unwrapping algorithm. The MR-ARFI pulse sequence used a 2DFT spin-echo with repeated bipolar encoding gradients in the direction of the longitudinal ultrasound beam. MR-ARFI interrogations scanned a sub-region (14 mm × 10 mm × 12 mm) of the brain surrounding the calcification. They were combined into a single displacement weighted map, using the sum of squares method. Calcification size estimates were based on image profiles plotted along the ±x and ±z direction, at the full width half maximum. Results: Both MR-ARFI and SWI were able to visualize the calcifications. The contrast ratio was 150 for CT, 12 for MR SWI, and 12 for MR-ARFI. Profile measures were 1.35mm × 1.28mm on CT, 1.24mm × 1.73mm on SWI, and 2.45mm × 3.02mm on MR-ARFI. MR-ARFI displacement showed a linear increase with acoustic power (20W - 80W), and also increased with calcification size. Conclusion: The use of SWI filtered phase and MR-ARFI have the potential to provide a clinical indicator of calcification relevance in the planning of a transcranial MRgFUS treatment.",2014 May
676,"Mackenzie NCW,Staines KA,Zhu D,Genever P,MacRae VE",miRNA-221 and miRNA-222 synergistically function to promote vascular calcification.,"Vascular calcification shares many similarities with skeletal mineralisation and involves the phenotypic trans-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to osteoblastic cells within a calcified environment. Various microRNAs (miRs) are known to regulate cell differentiation; however, their role in mediating VSMC calcification is not fully understood. miR-microarray analysis revealed the significant down-regulation of a range of miRs following nine days in culture, including miR-199b, miR-29a, miR-221, miR-222 and miR-31 (p < 0.05). Subsequent studies investigated the specific role of the miR-221/222 family in VSMC calcification. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction data confirmed the down-regulation of miR-221 (32.4%; p < 0.01) and miR-222 (15.7%; p < 0.05). VSMCs were transfected with mimics of miR-221 and miR-222, individually and in combination. Increased calcium deposition was observed in the combined treatment (two-fold; p < 0.05) but not in individual treatments. Runx2 and Msx2 expression was increased during calcification, but no difference in expression was observed following transfection with miR mimics. Interestingly, miR-221 and miR-222 mimics induced significant changes in ectonucleotide phosphodiesterase 1 (Enpp1) and Pit-1 expression, suggesting that these miRs may modulate VSMC calcification through cellular inorganic phosphate and pyrophosphate levels. © 2013 The Authors.

677,"Kukkonen MK,Vehmas T,Piirilä P,Hirvonen A",Genes involved in innate immunity associated with asbestos-related fibrotic changes.,"Objectives: To determine whether genetic polymorphisms in several candidate genes related to innate immunity and protease–antiprotease balance modify individual susceptibility to develop asbestos-related fibrotic pleuropulmonary changes. Methods: Sixteen polymorphisms from nine genes (NLRP3, CARD8, TNF, TGFB1, GC, MMP1, MMP9, MMP12 and TIMP2) were genotyped from 951 Finnish asbestos-exposed workers. The genotype/haplotype data were compared to signs of fibrosis and pleural thickenings using linear and logistic regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders. Results: A functional polymorphism (Q705K; rs35829419) in the NLRP3 gene was associated with interstitial lung fibrosis (p=0.013), and the TGFB1 rs2241718 SNP with visceral pleural fibrosis (VPF) (p=0.044). In stratified analysis, the carriage of at least one NLRP3 variant allele conferred a 2.5-fold increased risk for pathological interstitial lung fibrosis (OR 2.44, 95% CI 0.97 to 6.14). Conversely, the carriage of at least one TGFB1 rs2241718 variant allele protected against VPF (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.98). The TIMP2 rs2277698 SNP and a haplotype consisting of the TGFB1 rs1800469 and rs1800470 SNPs were associated with the degree of pleural thickening calcification (p=0.037 and p=0.035), and the CARD8 rs2043211 SNP with the greatest thickness of pleural plaques (p=0.015). Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that the NLRP3 inflammasome is important in the development of fibrotic lung disease by associating the NLRP3 rs35829419 variant allele with increased risk of asbestos-related interstitial lung fibrosis, and the TGFB1 rs2241718 variant allele with decreased risk of asbestos-related VPF. Polymorphisms in CARD8 and TIMP2 are proposed to modify the development and/or calcification of pleural thickenings.",2014 Jan

However, there is renewed clinical interest in 18F-NaF since prior technical and logistic limitations to its routine use are no longer present, and, as a consequence, it is likely that uptake unrelated to bone and non-osseous findings will be encountered more frequently. As a result of tumoral necrosis, soft tissue metastases may demonstrate 18F-NaF avidity due to dystrophic calcification. On the other hand, all non-osseous findings, whether 18F-NaF avid or not, may provide important diagnostic information that may alter the course of the disease, including treatment options. Herein we present a patient with ductal carcinoma of the breast in whom findings unrelated to the skeletal system in 18F-NaF PET/CT altered the treatment strategy.",2014 Mar
681,"Gao H,Bowles EA,Carrell D,Biust D",PS2-25: Using Natural Language Processing to Extract Findings from Mammography Reports.,"Background/Aims: Mammographic findings such as a mass may be associated with breast cancer risk, but these data are only available in free-text reports and require resource-intensive manual abstraction. We developed and tested a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm to extract mammographic findings (mass, calcification, asymmetric density, and architectural distortion) from free-text mammography reports. Methods: We identified 92,947 reports for women receiving screening and diagnostic mammography at Group Health between 2007–2008. We developed an NLP algorithm based on Perl Regular Expressions in SAS v9.2. The algorithm identifies words indicating mammography findings (mass, distortion, asymmetry and calcification) and their related words denoting laterality, negation, family history, personal history and uncertainty. Three flags are made indicating possible errors of the NLP algorithm. An experienced abstractor manually reviewed a random sample of 50 mammography reports to test and refine the NLP algorithm. Results: The algorithm correctly identified a mass on 46/50 reports, calcifications on 48/50 reports, asymmetric density on 50/50 reports, and architectural distortion on 48/50 reports. The NLP algorithm misinterprets sentences such as, “there are calcifications with no other asymmetry.” The NLP algorithm incorrectly associated the negation word “No” with the key word “calcifications.” Building more refined rules on association between negation words and key words will improve the accuracy. Conclusions: This NLP algorithm holds promise for accurate and fast identification of findings from free-text mammography reports. It can be shared across institutions and is an example of what can be done with free-text radiology reports, in addition to mammography. Manual review may still be necessary for some reports with a high probability of error, depending on resources available.",2013 Sep

Materials and Methods: This study included 26 confirmed cases of band-like interposing fat from June 2008 to June 2010. A retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and ultrasonographic findings in these cases. Five radiologists analyzed the ultrasonographic findings, which correlated with the mammographic and MRI findings when available, according to Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System classification. Results: None of the 26 patients had any symptoms. In 92.3% of the patients, the lesion was located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. The mean distance of the lesion from the nipple was 2.4 ± 0.7 cm (1.1-4.5). The mean depth of the lesion from the skin was 1.3 ± 0.3 cm (0.8-2.1). The mean maximal length of the lesion was 0.8 ± 0.4 cm (0.3-1.8). The following were the most frequent ultrasonographic findings of lesions: irregular shape, not parallel orientation, indistinct margins, abrupt interface, hypoechogenicity, no posterior feature, no calcification, and presence of vascularity. The most frequent BI-RADS category was 4a. There were no suspicious findings on the mammography or MRI. Conclusion: Ultrasonographic findings may lead to misclassification of band-like interposing fat as a malignancy.

683,"Farrar EJ,Butcher JT",Heterogeneous susceptibility of valve endothelial cells to mesenchymal transformation in response to TNFα.,"Lack of understanding of the early mechanisms of aortic valve stenosis and calcification hinders the development of diagnostic and therapeutic intervention strategies. Inflammation is a known component of early aortic valve disease (AVD) and can induce mesenchymal transformation in a subset of aortic valve endothelial cells. Here we present a three-dimensional culture system that allows transforming and non-transforming cells to be independently isolated and analyzed. We have used the system to identify and characterize the dynamic invasion and phenotypic transition of two distinct subsets of endothelial cells: those that invade and transform under TNFα treatment, and those that resist mesenchymal transformation and remain endothelial. We determine that non-transformed cells maintain control levels of endothelial genes VE-cadherin and eNOS, while transformed cells lose these endothelial characteristics and upregulate α-smooth muscle actin. Both subsets of cells have an inflammatory phenotype marked by increased ICAM-1, but transformed cells have increased MMP-9, Notch1, TGF-β, and BMP4, while non-transformed cells do not. Transformed cells also have distinct effects on alignment of collagen fibers as they invade the hydrogel system, which is not found in control endothelial or interstitial valve cells. Understanding the role of transforming and non-transforming endothelial cells in valve disease will provide an important pathological link between early inflammation and later stages of disease. Discovery of the molecular signature of transformation-resistant endothelial cells could inform development of treatment strategies that promote survival of the valve endothelium.",2014 Jan

In Nigeria, 25% of the population is infected. Lymph edema and elephantiasis are the predominant manifestations. Its infrequent manifestation is in the breast. This paper discusses the epidemiology, reviews literature, imaging options and mammographic appearances of these parasitic nematodes. Methods: This prospective descriptive study reports on 39 cases of parasitic calcifications seen during mammography in the Radiology Department, University College Hospital between 2006 and 2012 in Ibadan, South West Nigeria. Each mammogram was reported by MO and ATS: assigned a final Bi-RADs category. Parasitic calcifications were further evaluated for distribution, and types of calcification. Results: A total of 527 women had mammography done between 2006 and 2012. Thirty-nine women (7.4%) had parasitic breast calcifications. The ages of the women ranged between 38-71 years - mean of 52.36±8.72 SD. Twenty-three (59%) were post-menopausal, 16(41%) were pre-menopausal. The majority (31; 79.5%) were screeners while 8(20.5%) were follow up cases. Approximately half (51.3%) of the women had no complaints. Pain (23.1%) was the commonest presentation in the remaining half. Solitary calcifications were predominant (20) while only 3 cases had 10 calcifications. Left sided calcifications (53.8%) were the majority. Calcifications were subcutaneous in 2/3rds of the women (66.7%) while the Yoruba tribe (84.6%) was principal. Conclusion: Parasitic breast calcifications can be misdiagnosed on mammography for suspicious micro-calcification.

We report a case of a female with breast cancer presented with a rash around a previous mastectomy site and a discharge lesion on her right chest wall in August 2010. Biopsy of the lesion showed dystrophic calcification and metaplastic bone formation. The patient's history revealed a long term use of zoledronic acid for the treatment of breast cancer with bone metastasis. We stopped the treatment since we believed that the cutaneous dystrophic calcification could be associated with her long term bisphosphonate therapy. Adverse cutaneous events with bisphosphonates are very rare, and dystrophic calcification has not been reported previously. The dystrophic calcification and metaplastic bone formation in this patient are thought to be due to long term bisphosphonate usage.",2013
687,"Limite G,Esposito E,Sollazzo V,Ciancia G,Di Micco R,De Rosa D,Forestieri P",Lobular intraepithelial neoplasia arising within breast fibroadenoma.,"Background: Fibroadenomas are the second most common breast pathology occurring in young women under the age of 35 years old. Fibroadenomas can be classified as simple or complex according to histological features. Complex fibroadenomas differ from simple fibroadenomas because of the presence of cysts (3 mm), sclerosing adenosis, epithelial calcifications, or papillary apocrine changes. Most fibroadenomas are clinically identifiable. In 25% of cases, fibroadenomas are non-palpable and are diagnosed with mammography and ultrasound. Differential diagnosis with well differentiated breast cancer is often necessary, particularly with medullary or mucinous tumors. Calcification findings within fibroadenomas by mammogram have to be investigated. The age of a lump is usually reflected by calcifications. Microcalcification can hide foci of carcinoma in situ when they are small, branching type, and heterogeneous. However, many morphological possibilities may not be reliable for deciding whether a certain calcification is the product of a malignant or a benign process. From a radiological point of view, fibroadenomas containing foci of carcinoma in situ can be indistinguishable from benign lesions, even if the incidence of carcinoma within fibroadenomas is estimated as 0.1–0.3%, and it could be a long-term risk factor for invasive breast cancer. Case presentation: A 44-year-old woman presented with a 1.5-cm palpable, smooth, mobile lump in the lower-inner quadrant of her right breast. Standard mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal mammograms showed a cluster of eccentric popcorn-like calcifications within the fibroadenoma. After lumpectomy, a definitive histological examination confirmed the intra-operative diagnosis of a benign mass. However, lobular intraepithelial neoplasia foci were found, surrounded by atypical lobular hyperplasia. Conclusions: The possibility of an old benign breast lump might be supported by fine needle aspiration biopsy or core biopsy before initiating follow-up. According to our experience, when patients are older than 40 years and have a familial history of breast cancer, we prefer to carry out lumpectomy with follow up to avoid the risk of underestimation in situ foci within the lump.",2013
688,"Zhang Z,Shively JE","Acceleration of Bone Repair in NOD/SCID Mice by Human Monoosteophils, Novel LL-37-Activated Monocytes.","Background: An incomplete understanding of bone forming cells during wound healing and ectopic calcification has led to a search for circulating cells that may fulfill this function. Previously, we showed that monoosteophils, a novel lineage of calcifying/bone-forming cells generated by treatment of monocytes with the natural peptide LL-37, are candidates. In this study, we have analyzed their gene expression profile and bone repair function. Methods and Findings: Human monoosteophils can be distinguished from monocytes, macrophages and osteoclasts by their unique up-regulation of integrin α3 and down-regulation of CD14 and CD16. Monoosteophils express high mRNA and protein levels of SPP1 (osteopontin), GPNMB (osteoactivin), CHI3L1 (cartilage glycoprotein-39), CHIT1 (Chitinase 1), MMP-7, CCL22 and MAPK13 (p38MAPKδ). Monocytes from wild type, but not MAPK13 KO mice are also capable of monoosteophil differentiation, suggesting that MAPK13 regulates this process. When human monoosteophils were implanted in a freshly drilled hole in mid-diaphyseal femurs of NOD/SCID mice, significant bone repair required only 14 days compared to at least 24 days in control treated injuries. Conclusion: Human derived monoosteophils, characterized as CD45+α3+α3β+CD34−CD14−BAP (bone alkaline phosphatase)− cells, can function in an animal model of bone injury.",2013
689,"Li Q,Uitto J",Mineralization/Anti-Mineralization Networks in the Skin and Vascular Connective Tissues.,"Ectopic mineralization has been linked to several common clinical conditions with considerable morbidity and mortality. The mineralization processes, both metastatic and dystrophic, affect the skin and vascular connective tissues. There are several contributing metabolic and environmental factors that make uncovering of the precise pathomechanisms of these acquired disorders exceedingly difficult. Several relatively rare heritable disorders share phenotypic manifestations similar to those in common conditions, and, consequently, they serve as genetically controlled model systems to study the details of the mineralization process in peripheral tissues. This overview will highlight diseases with mineral deposition in the skin and vascular connective tissues, as exemplified by familial tumoral calcinosis, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, generalized arterial calcification of infancy, and arterial calcification due to CD73 deficiency. These diseases, and their corresponding mouse models, provide insight into the pathomechanisms of soft tissue mineralization and point to the existence of intricate mineralization/anti-mineralization networks in these tissues. This information is critical for understanding the pathomechanistic details of different mineralization disorders, and it has provided the perspective to develop pharmacological approaches to counteract the consequences of ectopic mineralization.",2013 Jul

The aim of this study was to determine whether Nixon’s nomogram can be validated in a Chinese population. Materials and Methods: All consecutive patients with thyroid nodules who underwent surgery between January and June 2012 in our hospital were enrolled to validate Nixon’s nomogram. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the risk factors for thyroid carcinoma. Discrimination and calibration were employed to evaluate the performance of Nixon’s model in our population. Results: A total of 348 consecutive patients with 409 thyroid nodules were enrolled. Thyroid ultrasonographic characteristics, including shape, echo texture, calcification, margins, vascularity and number (solitary vs. multiple nodules), were associated with malignance in the multivariate analysis. The discrimination of all nodules group, the group with a low risk of malignancy (predictive proportion <50%) and the group with a high risk of malignancy (predictive proportion ≥50%) using Nixon’s nomogram was satisfactory, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the three groups were 0.87, 0.75 and 0.72, respectively. However, the calibration was significant (p = 0.55) only in the high-risk group. Conclusion: Nixon’s nomogram is a valuable predictive model for the Chinese population and has been externally validated. It has good performance for patients with a high risk of malignancy and may be more suitable for use with these patients in China.",2013

This distinction can be difficult on core needle biopsy (CNB) but can have significant clinical ramifications. We examined the clinical course of patients diagnosed on CNB with borderline ADH/DCIS lesions [marked ADH (MADH)] at our institution. A total of 74 patients were diagnosed with MADH on CNB and underwent an excisional biopsy (EB). The majority of these CNBs reviewed at outside hospitals had been classified as DCIS. Twenty patients (27%) had benign findings or lobular neoplasia in their EB, 18 (24%) had ADH, 33 (45%) had DCIS, and 3 (4%) had DCIS and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Among the 38 patients who were not diagnosed with DCIS or IDC on EB, no patient underwent further surgery or radiation post-operatively. Thirty-seven of these 38 patients had no recurrences, whereas 1 patient developed a “recurrence” that on our review was likely residual localized MADH. The mean follow-up for these patients was 54 months. Of the 36 patients diagnosed with DCIS or IDC on EB, < 20% required mastectomy. On review, MADH involving an intermediate-sized duct on CNB and the amount of residual lesion on imaging was significantly associated with DCIS or IDC on EB. Conversely, MADH involving columnar cell lesions and the presence of calcification on CNB were significantly associated with benign pathology on EB. In conclusion, our study provides preliminary data that justify a conservative approach to borderline ADH/DCIS lesions on CNB: that is, diagnose as MADH and treat by conservative excision.",2013 Jun

To assess test sets for screening mammography, a gold-standard for whether a woman should be recalled for additional work-up is needed, given that interval cancers may be occult on mammography and some findings ultimately determined to be benign require additional imaging to determine if biopsy is warranted. Using experts to set a gold-standard assumes little variation occurs in their interpretations, but this has not been explicitly studied in mammography. Materials and Methods: Using digitized films from 314 screening mammography exams (n=143 cancer cases) performed in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, we evaluated interpretive agreement among three expert radiologists who independently assessed whether each examination should be recalled, and the lesion location, finding type (mass, calcification, asymmetric density, or architectural distortion), and interpretive difficulty in the recalled images. Results: Agreement among the three expert pairs for recall/no recall was higher for cancer cases (mean 74.3 ± 6.5) than for non-cancers (mean 62.6 ± 7.1). Complete agreement on recall, lesion location, finding type and difficulty ranged from 36.4%–42.0% for cancer cases and from 43.9%–65.6% for non-cancer cases. Two of three experts agreed on recall and lesion location for 95.1% of cancer cases and 91.8% of non-cancer cases, but all three experts agreed on only 55.2% of cancer cases and 42.1% of non-cancer cases. Conclusion: Variability in expert interpretive is notable. A minimum of three independent experts combined with a consensus should be used for establishing any gold-standard interpretation for test sets, especially for non-cancer cases.",2013 Jun

694,"SONMEZ FC,GUCIN Z,YILDIZ P,TOSUNER Z",Hamartoma of the breast in two patients: A case report.,"Breast hamartomas are rare, benign, tumor-like nodules composed of glandular, adipose and fibrous tissue. The hamartoma was first described in 1971 as a lipofibroadenoma, fibroadenolipoma or adenolipoma, based on the predominant component of the breast tissue. Clinical findings resemble fibroadenoma and if there is a palpable mass, the patients may receive an immediate diagnosis. Ductal hyperplasia, apocrine metaplasia, calcification and adenosis may occur within the hamartoma, with rarer instances of lobular or ductal intraepithelial neoplasms. Although hamartoma is usually benign, a malignant transformation is possible. An excision and histological examination is necessary for the differential diagnosis and also for any epithelial lesions of the hamartoma. Simple excision is enough for treatment if there is no coincidental epithelial malignant lesion. The patients in the present study were treated by simple excision as there were no proliferative changes in the lesions. No recurrence or other problems were detected in the 18-month follow-up. The current study presents two cases of breast hamartoma that were diagnosed as an adenolipoma and a fibroadenolipoma, and then describes the macroscopic and microscopic observations of these lesions.",2013 Aug

Both aging and CKD can disrupt calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis and cause alterations of multiple Ca2+-regulatory mechanisms, including parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor-23/Klotho, calcium-sensing receptor and Ca2+-phosphate product. These alterations can be deleterious to bone mineral metabolism and soft tissue health, leading to metabolic bone disease and vascular calcification and aging, termed CKD-mineral and bone disorder (MBD). CKD-MBD is associated with morbid clinical outcomes, including fracture, cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.

696,"Lee JS,Tung CH",Osteotropic cancer diagnosis by an osteocalcin inspired molecular imaging mimetic.,"Background: Although microcalcifications of hydroxyapatite can be found in both benign and malignant osteotropic tumors, they are mostly seen in proliferative lesions, including carcinoma. The aim of this present study is to develop a molecular imaging contrast agent for selective identification of hydroxyapatite calcification in human osteotropic tumor tissues ex vivo and in human osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Methods: A bioinspired biomarker, hydroxyapatite binding peptide (HABP), was designed to mimic natural protein osteocalcin property in vivo. A fluorescein isothiocyanate dye conjugated HABP (HABP-19) was utilized to characterize hydroxyapatite on human osteotropic tumor tissue sections ex vivo and to selectively image hydroxyapatite calcifications in human osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Results: Using a HABP-19 molecular imaging probe, we have shown that it is possible to selectively image hydroxyapatite calcifications in osteotropic cancers ex vivo and in human SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Conclusion: Hydroxyapatite calcifications were selectively detected in osteotropic tissues ex vivo and in the early stage of the calcification process of SaOS-2 human osteosarcoma in vitro using our HABP-19 molecular imaging probe. This new target-selective molecular imaging probe makes it possible to study the earliest events associated with hydroxyapatite deposition in various osteotropic cancers at the cellular and molecular levels. General significance: It potentially could be used to diagnose and treat osteotropic cancer or to anchor therapeutic agents directing the local distribution of desired therapy at calcified sites.",2013 Oct
697,DeCoursey TE,"Voltage-Gated Proton Channels: Molecular Biology, Physiology, and Pathophysiology of the HV Family.","Voltage-gated proton channels (HV) are unique, in part because the ion they conduct is unique. HV channels are perfectly selective for protons and have a very small unitary conductance, both arguably manifestations of the extremely low H+ concentration in physiological solutions. They open with membrane depolarization, but their voltage dependence is strongly regulated by the pH gradient across the membrane (ΔpH), with the result that in most species they normally conduct only outward current. The HV channel protein is strikingly similar to the voltage-sensing domain (VSD, the first four membrane-spanning segments) of voltage-gated K+ and Na+ channels. In higher species, HV channels exist as dimers in which each protomer has its own conduction pathway, yet gating is cooperative. HV channels are phylogenetically diverse, distributed from humans to unicellular marine life, and perhaps even plants. Correspondingly, HV functions vary widely as well, from promoting calcification in coccolithophores and triggering bioluminescent flashes in dinoflagellates to facilitating killing bacteria, airway pH regulation, basophil histamine release, sperm maturation, and B lymphocyte responses in humans. Recent evidence that hHV1 may exacerbate breast cancer metastasis and cerebral damage from ischemic stroke highlights the rapidly expanding recognition of the clinical importance of hHV1.",2013 Apr

BPs induced osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a relatively rare but severe clinical condition cited in English literature since 2003 while exact pathogenesis of BPs induced ONJ is not known until today, but numerous hypotheses were described in recent literature that promote and interlinked the development of BPs induced ONJ. These hypotheses indicate multifactorial nature of its development and factors responsible for that are; long term administration of intravenous nitrogen containing BPs in cancer patients, biological behavior of jaw, antiangiogenic property of BPs and by soft-tissue toxicity etc., All these factors are compounded by the presence of infection that are responsible for lower the pH of the oral cavity, other drugs like administration of corticosteroid, pathologies that cause hypo-calcification of bone, compromised immune response that alters normal healing such as renal transplantation followed by long term oral BPs therapy or chronic diabetic patients receiving BPs therapy and any dentoalveolar trauma.

The concept that similar pathways control both bone remodeling and vascular calcification is widely accepted, but the precise mechanisms of calcification remain largely unknown. The central role of microRNAs (miRNA) as fine-tune regulators in the cardiovascular system and bone biology has gained acceptance and has raised the possibility for novel therapeutic targets. Additionally, circulating miRNAs have been proposed as biomarkers for a wide range of cardiovascular diseases, but knowledge of miRNA biology in cardiovascular calcification is very limited. This review focuses on the role of miRNA in cardiovascular disease, with emphasis on osteogenic processes. Herein, we discuss the current understanding of miRNAs in cardiovascular calcification. Furthermore, we identify a set of miRNAs common to diseases associated with cardiovascular calcification (CKD, T2D, and atherosclerosis), and we hypothesize that these miRNAs may provide a molecular signature for calcification. Finally, we discuss this novel hypothesis with emphasis on known biological and pathological osteogenic processes (e.g. osteogenic differentiation, release of calcifying matrix vesicles). The aim of this review is to provide an organized discussion of the known links between miRNA and calcification that provide emerging concepts for future studies on miRNA biology in cardiovascular calcification, which will be critical for developing new therapeutic strategies.",2013 Mar 29

EMCS comprises only 2 % of all soft tissue sarcomas and only 6 % of them arise from soft tissue in the head and neck region. It usually affects in the second and third decade of life and is common in women. It runs a very rapid clinical course with distant metastases and has poor prognosis and survival rates. Histologically it has a dimorphic presentation of small round mesenchymal cells interspersed with foci of cartilaginous differentiation. Radiographically it appears as a soft tissue lobulated mass with various patterns of calcification. This is the first case of primary and recurrent EMCS originating in the buccal space with unusual features of dedifferentiation. The diagnostic challenges in this case were the inconclusive FNAC results, lack of radiographic evidence of characteristic calcifications and presence of areas of myxoid material and dedifferentiation on histopathology. The clinical, cytological, histological, immunohistochemical, radiographic, PET-CT findings and management with review of literature is presented.

In this study, we investigated the miRNA expression signatures of cell cultures undergoing osteoblastic and osteocytic differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) using mouse MSC line KUSA-A1 and human MSCs. Ninety types of miRNA were quantified during osteoblastic/osteocytic differentiation in KUSA-A1 cells utilizing miRNA PCR arrays. Coincidently with mRNA induction of the osteoblastic and osteocytic markers, the expression levels of several dozen miRNAs including miR-30 family, let-7 family, miR-21, miR-16, miR-155, miR-322 and Snord85 were changed during the differentiation process. These miRNAs were predicted to recognize osteogenic differentiation-, stemness-, epinegetics-, and cell cycle-related mRNAs, and were thus designated OstemiR. Among those OstemiR, the miR-30 family was classified into miR-30b/c and miR-30a/d/e groups on the basis of expression patterns during osteogenesis as well as mature miRNA structures. In silico prediction and subsequent qRT-PCR in stable miR-30d transfectants clarified that context-dependent targeting of miR-30d on known regulators of bone formation including osteopontin/spp1, lifr, ccn2/ctgf, ccn1/cyr61, runx2, sox9 as well as novel key factors including lin28a, hnrnpa3, hspa5/grp78, eed and pcgf5. In addition, knockdown of human OstemiR miR-541 increased Osteopontin/SPP1 expression and calcification in hMSC osteoblastic differentiation, indicating that miR-541 is a negative regulator of osteoblastic differentiation. These observations indicate stage-specific roles of OstemiR especially miR-541 and the miR-30 family on novel targets in osteogenesis.",2013

Our Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-approved database consists of 44,397 consecutive structured mammography reports for 20,375 patients collected from 2005 to 2008. The reports include demographic risk factors (age, family and personal history of breast cancer, and use of hormone therapy) and mammographic features from the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon. We calculated MI using Shannon’s entropy measure for each feature with respect to the outcome (benign/malignant using a cancer registry match as reference standard). In order to evaluate the validity of the MI rankings of features, we trained and tested naïve Bayes classifiers on the feature with tenfold cross-validation, and measured the predictive ability using area under the ROC curve (AUC). We used a bootstrapping approach to assess the distributional properties of our estimates, and the DeLong method to compare AUC. Based on MI, we found that mass margins and mass shape were the most informative features for breast cancer diagnosis. Calcification morphology, mass density, and calcification distribution provided predictive information for distinguishing benign and malignant breast findings. Breast composition, associated findings, and special cases provided little information in this task. We also found that the rankings of mammographic features with MI and AUC were generally consistent. MI analysis provides a framework to determine the value of different mammographic features in the pursuit of optimal (i.e., accurate and efficient) breast cancer diagnosis.",2013 Oct

Cellular lipid metabolism plays an important role in biological mineralization. The physiological mechanisms of mineralization are likely to take place in tissues other than in bones and teeth under specific pathological conditions. For instance, vascular calcification in arteries of patients with renal failure, diabetes mellitus or atherosclerosis recapitulates the mechanisms of bone formation. Osteoporosis—a bone resorbing disease—and rheumatoid arthritis originating from the inflammation in the synovium are also affected by cellular lipid metabolism. The focus is on the lipid metabolism due to the effects of dietary lipids on bone health. These and other phenomena indicate that phospholipases may participate in bone remodelling as evidenced by their expression in smooth muscle cells, in bone forming osteoblasts, chondrocytes and in bone resorbing osteoclasts. Among various enzymes involved, phospholipases A1 or A2, phospholipase C, phospholipase D, autotaxin and sphingomyelinase are engaged in membrane lipid remodelling during early stages of mineralization and cell maturation in mineralization-competent cells. Numerous experimental evidences suggested that phospholipases exert their action at various stages of mineralization by affecting intracellular signaling and cell differentiation. The lipid metabolites—such as arachidonic acid, lysophospholipids, and sphingosine-1-phosphate are involved in cell signaling and inflammation reactions. Phospholipases are also important members of the cellular machinery engaged in matrix vesicle (MV) biogenesis and exocytosis. They may favour mineral formation inside MVs, may catalyse MV membrane breakdown necessary for the release of mineral deposits into extracellular matrix (ECM), or participate in hydrolysis of ECM. The biological functions of phospholipases are discussed from the perspective of animal and cellular knockout models, as well as disease implications, development of potent inhibitors and therapeutic interventions.",2013 Mar

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its disease-modifying effect remain elusive. This study sought to test the hypothesis that PC has calcium crystal-independent biological activities which are, at least in part, responsible for its disease-modifying activity. We found that PC inhibited the proliferation of OA fibroblast-like synoviocytes in the absence of calcium crystals. Consistent with its effect on cell proliferation, PC downregulated the expression of numerous genes classified in cell proliferation. PC also downregulated the expression of many genes classified in angiogenesis and inflammatory response including prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, interleukin-1 receptor, type I, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2. In contrast, PC upregulated the expression of many genes classified in musculoskeletal tissue development, including aggrecan, type I collagen, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5.

The goal of this article is to review existing evidence that the presence of BAC on mammography correlates with several (but not all) traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and with prevalent and incident CVD. Thus, BAC detected during routine mammography is a noteworthy finding that could be valuable in identifying asymptomatic women at increased future CVD risk that may be candidates for more aggressive management. In addition, there are notable differences in measures of subclinical atherosclerosis burden in women (ie, coronary artery calcification) by race/ethnic background, and the same appears to be true for BAC, although data are very limited. Another noteworthy limitation of prior research on BAC is the reliance on absence vs presence of BAC; no study to date has determined gradation of BAC. Further research is thus required to elucidate the role of BAC gradation in the prediction of CVD outcomes and to determine whether adding BAC gradation to prediction models based on traditional risk factors improves classification of CVD risk.",2013

710,"Peterlik M,Kállay E,Cross HS","Calcium Nutrition and Extracellular Calcium Sensing: Relevance for the Pathogenesis of Osteoporosis, Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases.","Through a systematic search in Pubmed for literature, on links between calcium malnutrition and risk of chronic diseases, we found the highest degree of evidence for osteoporosis, colorectal and breast cancer, as well as for hypertension, as the only major cardiovascular risk factor. Low calcium intake apparently has some impact also on cardiovascular events and disease outcome. Calcium malnutrition can causally be related to low activity of the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). This member of the family of 7-TM G-protein coupled receptors allows extracellular Ca2+ to function as a “first messenger” for various intracellular signaling cascades. Evidence demonstrates that Ca2+/CaSR signaling in functional linkage with vitamin D receptor (VDR)-activated pathways (i) promotes osteoblast differentiation and formation of mineralized bone; (ii) targets downstream effectors of the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathway to inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation of colorectal cancer cells; (iii) evokes Ca2+ influx into breast cancer cells, thereby activating pro-apoptotic intracellular signaling. Furthermore, Ca2+/CaSR signaling opens Ca2+-sensitive K+ conductance channels in vascular endothelial cells, and also participates in IP3-dependent regulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+, the key intermediate of cardiomyocyte functions. Consequently, impairment of Ca2+/CaSR signaling may contribute to inadequate bone formation, tumor progression, hypertension, vascular calcification and, probably, cardiovascular disease.",2013 Jan

Aims. To describe BD patterns in asymptomatic Mexican women and the pathological mammographic findings. Methods and Material. Prospective, descriptive, and comparative study. Women answered a questionnaire and their mammograms were analyzed according to BI-RADS. Univariate (χ2) and conditional logistic regression analyses were performed. Results. In 300 women studied the BD patterns were fat 56.7% (170), fibroglandular 29% (87), heterogeneously dense 5.7% (17), and dense pattern 8.6% (26). Prevalence of fat pattern was significantly different in women under 50 years (37.6%, 44/117) and older than 50 (68.8%, 126/183). Patterns of high breast density (BD) (dense + heterogeneously dense) were observed in 25.6% (30/117) of women ≤50 years and 7.1% (13/183) of women >50. Asymmetry in BD was observed in 22% (66/300).

However, little is known regarding the relationship between serum Ca2+ levels and the expression of Ca2+ channels in the presence of breast microcalcifications. Methods: A retrospective analysis of women newly diagnosed with breast microcalcifications was performed based on the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). The expression of TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPM7 using normal biopsy without microcalcifications (controls) and infiltrating ductal carcinoma with microcalcifications was evaluated. Results: Data on 138 women were analyzed. Seventy percent of women had a BI-RADS score (1–3) corresponding to benign disease. Seventy-six percent of women with a BI-RADS score (4 or 5) were diagnosed with breast cancer, 56% were cancers in situ, and 93% were infiltrating ductal carcinomas. No difference in the distribution of corrected serum Ca2+ levels between BI-RADS scores (1–3) and BI-RADS scores (4–5) (P = 0.82) was observed. Serum Ca2+ levels were similar in women without cancer and women diagnosed with breast cancer (P = 0.94). However, the expression of TRPM7 and TRPC1, but not TRPC3, Ca2+ channels were increased in infiltrating ductal carcinoma samples with microcalcifications when compared with age-matched controls without calcification or cancer. Conclusion: We observed an increase in the expression of TRPM7 and TRPC1 Ca2+ channels in infiltrating ductal carcinoma samples with microcalcifications, whereas no change in serum Ca2+ levels was observed. Together these data suggest that increased expression of these channels might lead to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels thereby restoring serum Ca2+ levels, but these can contribute to the breast microcalcifications. However, future studies exploring the intracellular Ca2+ levels as well as the role of TRPM7 and TRPC1 function according to BI-RADS scores are needed.",2013

Despite a thorough evaluation, and even performing an autopsy, the underlying cause of acute-onset hypercalcemia, resulting in the production of pulmonary calciphylaxis and metastatic renal calcification associated with acute respiratory and renal failure, could not be determined. Metastatic calcification often lacks specific symptoms, and the degree of calcification is a marker of the severity and chronicity of the disease. This unusual autopsy case emphasizes the importance of rapidly progressing visceral calciphylaxis, as well as its early detection.",2012 Dec

One possible mechanism by which Runx2 protein expression is induced is downregulation of inhibitory microRNAs (miR). Methods and Results: Human coronary artery SMCs (CASMCs) treated with bone morphogenetic protein‐2 (BMP‐2; 100 ng/mL) demonstrated a 1.7‐fold (P<0.02) increase in Runx2 protein expression at 24 hours. A miR microarray and target prediction database analysis independently identified miR‐30b and miR‐30c (miR‐30b‐c) as miRs that regulate Runx2 expression. Real‐time–polymerase chain reaction confirmed that BMP‐2 decreased miR‐30b and miR‐30c expression. A luciferase reporter assay verified that both miR‐30b and miR‐30c bind to the 3′‐untranslated region of Runx2 mRNA to regulate its expression. CASMCs transfected with antagomirs to downregulate miR‐30b‐c demonstrated significantly increased Runx2, intracellular calcium deposition, and mineralization. Conversely, forced expression of miR‐30b‐c by transfection with pre–miR‐30b‐c prevented the increase in Runx2 expression and mineralization of SMCs. Calcified human coronary arteries demonstrated higher levels of BMP‐2 and lower levels of miR‐30b than did noncalcified donor coronary arteries. Conclusions: BMP‐2 downregulates miR‐30b and miR‐30c to increase Runx2 expression in CASMCs and promote mineralization. Strategies that modulate expression of miR‐30b and miR‐30c may influence vascular calcification.",2012 Dec

Methods: A prospective, descriptive, multicenter study was conducted in the radiology sections of the Aga Khan University Hospital, Pakistan Naval Station Shifa Hospital, Advanced Radiology Clinic, Karachi Institute of Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine, and Civil Hospital Karachi between May and October 2010 after approval from the ethical review committee of Aga Khan University. Mammograms reported as BI-RADS category 4 and 5 were included in the study. Mammograms reported as BI-RADS category 0, 1, 2 and 3 were excluded. Fifty reports were collected from each center. Data were collected about the clinical indication, breast density, location and description of the lesion, calcification, and comments on axillary lymph nodes. This description was compared with the BI-RADS lexicon. Results: The mean age of the patients was 50 ± 12 years. The clinical indication, breast parenchymal density, lesion location, and presence of calcification were better described by the private centers, while description of lymph node status was better stated by the government centers. This difference was statistically significant, except for lesion description. The description of masses by the two reporting groups was comparable. Conclusion: Mammographic reporting of malignant breast lesions in the private sector is more in line with the BI-RADS lexicon, as compared with government sector hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. Lymph node documentation was better in government sector reports.",2012

Logical Differential Prediction Bayes Net (LDP-BN), that calculates the risk of breast disease based on mammography findings. LDP-BN uses Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to learn relational rules, selects older-specific differentially predictive rules, and incorporates them into a Bayes Net, significantly improving its performance. In addition, LDP-BN offers valuable insight into the classification process, revealing novel older-specific rules that link mass presence to invasive, and calcification presence and lack of detectable mass to DCIS.",2012

Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is an endogenous inhibitor of bone formation, and serum DKK1 has been associated with impaired osteoblast activation and susceptibility to bone loss. Plasma DKK1, BMD in the spine, and CP in three arterial beds were assessed in African-Americans (AAs) to determine relationships of serum DKK1 with atherosclerotic vascular calcification. Methods:: Plasma DKK1, computed tomography-derived trabecular volumetric BMD (vBMD) in thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, and coronary artery, carotid artery, and aortoiliac CP were measured in 450 unrelated AAs with type 2 diabetes. Generalized linear models were fitted to test for associations between DKK1, vBMD, and CP. Results:: Participants were 56% female with mean/sd/median age of 55.4/9.5/55.0 yr, diabetes duration of 10.3/8.2/8.0 yr, plasma DKK1 of 481.6/271.8/417 pg/ml, coronary artery CP mass score of 284/648/13, carotid artery CP mass score of 46/132/0, and aortoiliac CP mass score of 1613/2910/282. Adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, mean arterial blood pressure, smoking, hemoglobin A1c, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, DKK1 was inversely associated with coronary artery and aortoiliac CP [parameter estimates −0.0011 (P = 0.0137) and −0.0010 (P = 0.0214), respectively], with a trend for carotid artery CP (P = 0.1404). No associations were observed between DKK1 and vBMD in the thoracic or lumbar vertebrae. Conclusions:: Plasma DKK1 levels were inversely associated with coronary artery and aortoiliac CP, but not vBMD, in this cross-sectional study of AAs with type 2 diabetes. DKK1 may play a role in vascular mineral metabolism in this clinical setting.",2013 Jan

The clinical data and imaging findings of 13 female patients with histologically confirmed solid NEBC were reviewed. Imaging data were evaluated by two radiologists for a consensual diagnosis. All patients presented with one palpable mass; only 1 experienced occasional breast pain, and 5 complained of fluid discharge. In 7 patients, the masses were firm and mobile. Regional lymph node metastasis was noted in only 1 patient. For the 10 patients who underwent mammography, 6 had a mass, 1 had clustered small nodules with clustered punctuate microcalcifications, 2 had asymmetric focal density, and 1 had solitary punctuate calcification. Most of the masses had irregular shape with indistinct or microlobulated margins. For the 9 patients who underwent ultrasonography (US), 9 masses were depicted, all of which were hypoechoic, mostly with irregular shape and without acoustic phenomena. Different types of acoustic phenomena were also identified. One patient had developed distant metastases during follow-up. NEBC has a variety of presentations, but it is mostly observed on mammograms as a dense, irregular mass with indistinct or microlobulated margins. Sonographically, it typically presents as an irregular, heterogeneously hypoechoic mass with normal sound transmission. Histories of nipple discharge and calcification observed using imaging are not rare.",2012 Nov

No effective treatment exists so far. ATC frequently derive from papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), which have a good prognosis. In this study, we analyzed the mRNA expression profiles of 59 thyroid tumors (11 ATC and 48 PTC) by microarrays. ATC and PTC showed largely overlapping mRNA expression profiles with most genes regulated in all ATC being also regulated in several PTC. 43% of the probes regulated in all the PTC are similarly regulated in all ATC. Many genes modulations observed in PTC are amplified in ATC. This illustrates the fact that ATC mostly derived from PTC. A molecular signature of aggressiveness composed of 9 genes clearly separates the two tumors. Moreover, this study demonstrates gene regulations corresponding to the ATC or PTC phenotypes like inflammatory reaction, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion, high proliferation rate, dedifferentiation, calcification and fibrosis processes, high glucose metabolism and glycolysis, lactate generation and chemoresistance. The main qualitative differences between the two tumor types bear on the much stronger EMT, dedifferentiation and glycolytic phenotypes showed by the ATC.",2012

It detects low-frequency harmonic vibrations in tissue that are induced by the radiation force of ultrasound. Here, we have investigated applications of VA for in vivo breast imaging. Methods: A recently developed combined mammography-VA system for in vivo breast imaging was tested on female volunteers, aged 25 years or older, with suspected breast lesions on their clinical examination. After mammography, a set of VA scans was acquired by the experimental device. In a masked assessment, VA images were evaluated independently by 3 reviewers who identified mass lesions and calcifications. The diagnostic accuracy of this imaging method was determined by comparing the reviewers' responses with clinical data. Results: We collected images from 57 participants: 7 were used for training and 48 for evaluation of diagnostic accuracy (images from 2 participants were excluded because of unexpected imaging artifacts). In total, 16 malignant and 32 benign lesions were examined. Specificity for diagnostic accuracy was 94% or higher for all 3 reviewers, but sensitivity varied (69% to 100%). All reviewers were able to detect 97% of masses, but sensitivity for detection of calcification was lower (≤ 72% for all reviewers). Conclusions: VA can be used to detect various breast abnormalities, including calcifications and benign and malignant masses, with relatively high specificity. VA technology may lead to a new clinical tool for breast imaging applications.",2012

724,"Destounis SV,Arieno AL,Morgan RC","CAD May Not be Necessary for Microcalcifications in the Digital era, CAD May Benefit Radiologists for Masses.","Objective:: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of computer-aided detection (CAD) to mark the cancer on digital mammograms at the time of breast cancer diagnosis and also review retrospectively whether CAD marked the cancer if visible on any available prior mammograms, thus potentially identifying breast cancer at an earlier stage. We sought to determine why breast lesions may or may not be marked by CAD. In particular, we analyzed factors such as breast density, mammographic views, and lesion characteristics. Materials and Methods:: Retrospective review from 2004 to 2008 revealed 3445 diagnosed breast cancers in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients; 1293 of these were imaged with full field digital mammography (FFDM). After cancer diagnosis, in a retrospective review held by the radiologist staff, 43 of these cancers were found to be visible on prior-year mammograms (false-negative cases); these breast cancer cases are the basis of this analysis. All cases had CAD evaluation available at the time of cancer diagnosis and on prior mammography studies. Data collected included patient demographics, breast density, palpability, lesion type, mammographic size, CAD marks on current- and prior-year mammograms, needle biopsy method, pathology results (core needle and/or surgical), surgery type, and lesion size. Results:: On retrospective review of the mammograms by the staff radiologists, 43 cancers were discovered to be visible on prior-year mammograms. All 43 cancers were masses (mass classification included mass, mass with calcification, and mass with architectural distortion); no pure microcalcifications were identified in this cohort. Mammograms with CAD applied at the time of breast cancer diagnosis were able to detect 79% (34/43) of the cases and 56% (24/43) from mammograms with CAD applied during prior year(s). In heterogeneously dense/extremely dense tissue, CAD marked 79% (27/34) on mammograms taken at the time of diagnosis and 56% (19/34) on mammograms with CAD applied during the prior year(s). At time of diagnosis, CAD marked lesions in 32% (11/34) on the craniocaudal (CC) view, 21% (7/34) on the mediolateral oblique (MLO) view. Lesion size of those marked by CAD or not marked were similar, the average being 15 and 12 mm, respectively. Conclusion:: CAD marked cancers on mammograms at the time of diagnosis in 79% of the cases and in 56% of the cases from the mammograms with CAD applied in the prior year(s). Our review demonstrated that CAD can mark invasive breast carcinomas in even dense breast tissue. CAD marked a significant portion on the CC view only, which may be an indicator to radiologists to be especially vigilant when a lesion is marked on this view.",2012
725,"Fathala A,Al Amer A,Shukri M,Abouzied MM,Alsugair A",The relationship between coronary artery calcification and myocardial perfusion in asymptomatic women.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: No data are available in Saudi Arabia on the relationship between coronary artery calcification (CAC) and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) in asymptomatic women, for determining subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD). The main objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the presence of CAC and stress-induced myocardial ischemia by MPS in asymptomatic women. DESIGN AND SETTING: Single-center retrospective study over a 2-year period. METHODS: One hundred and one women (mean [SD] age, 56 [11] years) without known CAD underwent both MPS and CAC scanning within 3 months. The frequency of ischemia by MPS was compared with the presence or absence of CAC and the number of CAD risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of ischemic MPS was 22% (22/101). Among the 22 patients with ischemic MPS, the CAC score was 0 in 5 patients of 22 (23%), 1 to 200 in 4 patients of 22 (18%), and more than 200 in 13 patients of 22 (59%) (P=.0001). In contrast, among the 79 patients with normal MPS, the CAC score was 0 in 44 of 79 (56%) patients, 1 to 200 in 25 of 79 (32%), and more than 200 in 10 of 79 (13%). The presence or absence of CAC was the single most important predictor of the MPS result (P=.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to severe CAC is associated with ischemic MPS in more than 50% of asymptomatic women with 2 or more CAD risk factors. Abnormal MPS is rarely associated with a 0 CAC score. Normal MPS does not exclude subclinical CAD. Therefore, CAC screening is an appropriate initial screening test for CAD in asymptomatic women.",2012 Jul-Aug

We report a case of unsuspected papillary thyroid carcinoma with skull metastasis. A 48-year-old female patient presenting with painless, pulsatile, progressively increasing swelling in the occipitoparietal region of the scalp approached for an X-ray of the skull. Ultrasound of palpable swelling in the neck revealed a heteroechoic lesion with increased vascularity. Foci of calcification were seen involving both lobes of the thyroid. Ultrasound of scalp showed a destructive mass in the skull with increased vascularity. Biopsy of thyroid lesions revealed branching papillae having a dense fibrovascular core covered by cuboidal epithelial cells with nuclei having a clear ground glass appearance. This case illustrates how isolated extensive skull metastasis can be found in papillary carcinoma patients without causing significant morbidity. Therefore, in the clinical course of thyroid papillary carcinoma, skull metastasis should be considered, and the patients should be meticulously investigated and followed up.",2012 Jun 28

Notch signaling regulates tissue development and participates in innate and adaptive immunity in adults. The role of Notch signaling in cardiometabolic inflammation, however, remains obscure. We noted that a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet increased expression of the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 (Dll4) in atheromata and fat tissue in LDL-receptor–deficient mice. Blockade of Dll4-Notch signaling using neutralizing anti-Dll4 antibody attenuated the development of atherosclerosis, diminished plaque calcification, improved insulin resistance, and decreased fat accumulation. These changes were accompanied by decreased macrophage accumulation, diminished expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and lower levels of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. In vitro cell culture experiments revealed that Dll4-mediated Notch signaling increases MCP-1 expression via NF-κB, providing a possible mechanism for in vivo effects. Furthermore, Dll4 skewed macrophages toward a proinflammatory phenotype (“M1”). These results suggest that Dll4-Notch signaling plays a central role in the shared mechanism for the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic disorders.",2012 Jul 3

An additional aim was to determine how the standard European method of measuring image quality using threshold gold thickness measured with a CDMAM phantom and the associated limits in current EU guidelines relate to calcification detection. Methods:: One hundred and sixty two normal breast images were acquired on an amorphous selenium direct digital (DR) system. Microcalcification clusters extracted from magnified images of slices of mastectomies were electronically inserted into half of the images. The calcification clusters had a subtle appearance. All images were adjusted using a validated mathematical method to simulate the appearance of images from a computed radiography (CR) imaging system at the same dose, from both systems at half this dose, and from the DR system at quarter this dose. The original 162 images were processed with both Hologic and Agfa (Musica-2) image processing. All other image qualities were processed with Agfa (Musica-2) image processing only. Seven experienced observers marked and rated any identified suspicious regions. Free response operating characteristic (FROC) and ROC analyses were performed on the data. The lesion sensitivity at a nonlesion localization fraction (NLF) of 0.1 was also calculated. Images of the CDMAM mammographic test phantom were acquired using the automatic setting on the DR system. These images were modified to the additional image qualities used in the observer study. The images were analyzed using automated software. In order to assess the relationship between threshold gold thickness and calcification detection a power law was fitted to the data. Results:: There was a significant reduction in calcification detection using CR compared with DR: the alternative FROC (AFROC) area decreased from 0.84 to 0.63 and the ROC area decreased from 0.91 to 0.79 (p < 0.0001). This corresponded to a 30% drop in lesion sensitivity at a NLF equal to 0.1. Detection was also sensitive to the dose used. There was no significant difference in detection between the two image processing algorithms used (p > 0.05). It was additionally found that lower threshold gold thickness from CDMAM analysis implied better cluster detection. The measured threshold gold thickness passed the acceptable limit set in the EU standards for all image qualities except half dose CR. However, calcification detection varied significantly between image qualities. This suggests that the current EU guidelines may need revising. Conclusions:: Microcalcification detection was found to be sensitive to detector and dose used. Standard measurements of image quality were a good predictor of microcalcification cluster detection.",2012 Jun

To date, most studies have focused on either coral bleaching due to warming oceans or declining calcification due to decreasing oceanic carbonate ion concentrations. Here, through the use of physiology measurements and cDNA microarrays, we show that changes in pH and ocean chemistry consistent with two scenarios put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) drive major changes in gene expression, respiration, photosynthesis and symbiosis of the coral, Acropora millepora, before affects on biomineralisation are apparent at the phenotype level. Under high CO2 conditions corals at the phenotype level lost over half their Symbiodinium populations, and had a decrease in both photosynthesis and respiration. Changes in gene expression were consistent with metabolic suppression, an increase in oxidative stress, apoptosis and symbiont loss. Other expression patterns demonstrate upregulation of membrane transporters, as well as the regulation of genes involved in membrane cytoskeletal interactions and cytoskeletal remodeling. These widespread changes in gene expression emphasize the need to expand future studies of ocean acidification to include a wider spectrum of cellular processes, many of which may occur before impacts on calcification.",2012
730,"Thompson B,Towler DA",Arterial calcification and bone physiology: role of the bone-vascular axis.,"Bone never forms without vascular interactions. This simple statement of fact does not adequately reflect the physiological and pharmacological implications of the relationship. The vasculature is the conduit for nutrient exchange between bone and the rest of the body. The vasculature provides the sustentacular niche for development of osteoblast progenitors, and is the conduit for egress of bone marrow cell products arising, in turn, from the osteoblast-dependent hematopoietic niche. Importantly, the second most calcified structure in humans after the skeleton is the vasculature. Once considered a passive process of dead and dying cells, vascular calcification has emerged as an actively regulated form of tissue biomineralization. Skeletal morphogens and osteochondrogenic transcription factors are elaborated by cells within the vessel wall, regulating the deposition of vascular calcium. Osteotropic hormones including parathyroid hormone regulate both vascular and skeletal mineralization. Cellular, endocrine, and metabolic signals flow bidirectionally between the vasculature and bone that are necessary for both bone health and vascular health. Dysmetabolic states including diabetes, uremia, and hyperlipidemia perturb the bone-vascular axis, giving rise to devastating vascular and skeletal disease. A detailed understanding of bone-vascular interactions is needed to address the unmet clinical needs of our increasingly aged and dysmetabolic population.",2012 Sep
731,Vermeer C,Vitamin K: the effect on health beyond coagulation – an overview.,"Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of proteins belonging to the Gla-protein family. To the members of this family belong four blood coagulation factors, which all are exclusively formed in the liver. The importance of vitamin K for hemostasis is demonstrated from the fact that vitamin K-deficiency is an acute, life-threatening condition due to excessive bleeding. Other members of the Gla-protein family are osteocalcin, matrix Gla-protein (MGP), and Gas6 that play key functions in maintaining bone strength, arterial calcification inhibition, and cell growth regulation, respectively. In total 17 Gla-proteins have been discovered at this time. Recently, it was observed that the dietary vitamin K requirement for the synthesis of the coagulation factors is much lower than for that of the extra-hepatic Gla-proteins. This forms the basis of the triage theory stating that during poor dietary supply, vitamins are preferentially utilized for functions that are important for immediate survival. This explains why in the healthy population all clotting factors are synthesized in their active form, whereas the synthesis of other Gla-proteins is sub-optimal in non-supplemented subjects. Prolonged sub-clinical vitamin K deficiency is a risk factor for osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Present recommendations for dietary intake are based on the daily dose required to prevent bleeding. Accumulating scientific data suggests that new, higher recommendations for vitamin K intake should be formulated.",2012
732,DeCoursey TE,Voltage-gated Proton Channels.,"Voltage-gated proton channels, HV1, have vaulted from the realm of the esoteric into the forefront of a central question facing ion channel biophysicists, namely the mechanism by which voltage-dependent gating occurs. This transformation is the result of several factors. Identification of the gene in 2006 revealed that proton channels are homologues of the voltage-sensing domain of most other voltage-gated ion channels. Unique, or at least eccentric, properties of proton channels include dimeric architecture with dual conduction pathways, perfect proton selectivity, a single-channel conductance ~103 smaller than most ion channels, voltage-dependent gating that is strongly modulated by the pH gradient, ΔpH, and potent inhibition by Zn2+ (in many species) but an absence of other potent inhibitors. The recent identification of HV1 in three unicellular marine plankton species has dramatically expanded the phylogenetic family tree. Interest in proton channels in their own right has increased as important physiological roles have been identified in many cells. Proton channels trigger the bioluminescent flash of dinoflagellates, facilitate calcification by coccolithophores, regulate pH-dependent processes in eggs and sperm during fertilization, secrete acid to control the pH of airway fluids, facilitate histamine secretion by basophils, and play a signaling role in facilitating B-cell receptor mediated responses in B lymphocytes. The most elaborate and best-established functions occur in phagocytes, where proton channels optimize the activity of NADPH oxidase, an important producer of reactive oxygen species. Proton efflux mediated by HV1 balances the charge translocated across the membrane by electrons through NADPH oxidase, minimizes changes in cytoplasmic and phagosomal pH, limits osmotic swelling of the phagosome, and provides substrate H+ for the production of H2O2 and HOCl, reactive oxygen species crucial to killing pathogens.",2012 Apr
733,"Zhao G,Xu MJ,Zhao MM,Dai XY,Kong W,Wilson GM,Guan Y,Wang CY,Wang X",Activation of nuclear factor-kappa B accelerates vascular calcification by inhibiting progressive ankylosis protein homolog expression.,"Vascular calcification is a major risk factor of cardiovascular mortality, particularly for patients with end-stage renal disease and diabetes. Although chronic inflammation is one of the etiologic factors, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. To clarify this, we studied how nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) induction, a mediator of inflammation, might promote vascular calcification. Activation of NF-κB by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) promoted inorganic phosphate-induced calcification in human aortic smooth muscle cells. Pyrophosphate (an inhibitor of calcification) efflux to the extracellular matrix was suppressed along with the decreased expression of ankylosis protein homolog (ANKH), a transmembrane protein that controls pyrophosphate efflux of cells. The restoration of ANKH expression in these cells overcame the decreased pyrophosphate efflux and calcification. Tristetraprolin, a downstream product of NF-κB activation, may mediate destablization of ANKH mRNA since its knockdown by shRNA increased ANKH expression and decreased calcification. Furthermore, a rat chronic renal failure model, with increased serum TNF levels, activated NF-κB and decreased ANKH levels. In contrast, the inhibition of NF-κB maintained ANKH expression and attenuated vascular calcification both in vivo and in vitro. Both human calcified atherosclerotic lesions and arteries from patients with chronic kidney disease had activated NF-κB and decreased ANKH expression. Thus, TNF-activated NF-κB promotes inflammation-accelerated vascular calcification by inhibiting ankylosis protein homolog expression and consequent pyrophosphate secretion.",2012 Jul
734,"Cancela ML,Conceição N,Laizé V","Gla-Rich Protein, a New Player in Tissue Calcification?123.","A novel γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla)-containing protein, named Gla-rich protein (GRP) after its high content in Gla residues or upper zone of growth plate and cartilage matrix associated protein after its preferential expression by cartilage chondrocyte, was recently identified in sturgeon, mice, and humans through independent studies. GRP is the most densely γ-carboxylated protein identified to date and its structure has been remarkably conserved throughout vertebrate evolution but is apparently absent from bird genomes. Several transcript and genomic variants affecting key protein features or regulatory elements were described and 2 paralogs were identified in the teleost fish genome. In the skeleton, most relevant levels of GRP gene expression were observed in cartilaginous tissues and associated with chondrocytes, suggesting a role in chondrogenesis. But GRP expression was also detected in bone cells, indicative of a more widespread role for the protein throughout skeletal formation. Although the molecular function of GRP is yet unknown, the high content of Gla residues and its accumulation at sites of pathological calcification in different human pathologies affecting skin or the vascular system and in breast cancer tumors suggest that GRP may function as a modulator of calcium availability. Because of its association with fibrillar collagens, GRP could also be involved in the organization and/or stabilization of cartilage matrix.

Orai and STIM proteins are almost ubiquitously expressed in human cells, where SOCE has been reported to play a relevant functional role. The phenotype of patients bearing mutations in STIM and Orai proteins, together with models of STIM or Orai deficiency in mice, as well as other organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster, have provided compelling evidence on the relevant role of these proteins in cellular physiology and pathology. Orai1-deficient patients suffer from severe immunodeficiency, congenital myopathy, chronic pulmonary disease, anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia and defective dental enamel calcification. STIM1-deficient patients showed similar abnormalities, as well as autoimmune disorders. This review summarizes the current evidence that identifies and explains diseases induced by disturbances in SOCE due to deficiencies or mutations in Orai and STIM proteins.",2012 Mar
736,"Macklin P,Edgerton ME,Thompson AM,Cristini V",Patient-calibrated agent-based modelling of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): From microscopic measurements to macroscopic predictions of clinical progression.,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)—a significant precursor to invasive breast cancer—is typically diagnosed as microcalcifications in mammograms. However, the effective use of mammograms and other patient data to plan treatment has been restricted by our limited understanding of DCIS growth and calcification. We develop a mechanistic, agent-based cell model and apply it to DCIS. Cell motion is determined by a balance of biomechanical forces. We use potential functions to model interactions with the basement membrane and amongst cells of unequal size and phenotype. Each cell’s phenotype is determined by genomic/proteomic- and microenvironment-dependent stochastic processes. Detailed “sub-models” describe cell volume changes during proliferation and necrosis; we are the first to account for cell calcification.We introduce the first patient-specific calibration method to fully constrain the model based upon clinically-accessible histopathology data. After simulating 45 days of solid-type DCIS with comedonecrosis, the model predicts: necrotic cell lysis acts as a biomechanical stress relief, and is responsible for the linear DCIS growth observed in mammography; the rate of DCIS advance varies with the duct radius; the tumour grows 7 to 10 mm per year—consistent with mammographic data; and the mammographic and (post-operative) pathologic sizes are linearly correlated—in quantitative agreement with the clinical literature. Patient histopathology matches the predicted DCIS microstructure: an outer proliferative rim surrounds a stratified necrotic core with nuclear debris on its outer edge and calcification in the centre. This work illustrates that computational modelling can provide new insight on the biophysical underpinnings of cancer. It may one day be possible to augment a patient’s mammography and other imaging with rigorously-calibrated models that help select optimal surgical margins based upon the patient’s histopathologic data.",2012 May 21
737,"Abou Hassan N,D’Orsi ET,D’Orsi CJ,O'Neill WC",The Risk for Medial Arterial Calcification in CKD.,"Background and objectives: CKD is a risk factor for medial artery calcification, but the CKD stage at which this risk begins is unknown. Because breast arterial calcification (BAC) is a marker of generalized medial arterial calcification, mammography was used to detect medial arterial calcification in women with different CKD stages. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study of women with and without CKD matched for age and diabetes and identified from mammograms obtained in 2006–2011. BAC was scored as present or absent per visual inspection. Results: A total of 146 women with stage 3 CKD and 54 with stage 4/5 CKD were identified. An additional 21 patients with ESRD were identified and added to a previous cohort of 71 patients. Mean age was 64 years for CKD 3, 63 for CKD 4, and 59 for ESRD. Half of each group had diabetes. Compared with controls, the odds ratios for BAC were 1.44 in CKD 3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82–2.53), 2.69 in CKD 4 (95% CI, 1.14–6.33), and 7.19 in ESRD (95% CI, 3.77–13.7) and did not differ with diabetic status or race. In a multivariable logistic model, age (P<0.001) and estimated GFR (P=0.005) were independent predictors of BAC. The odds ratio for BAC increased 4% for each milliliter per minute per 1.73 m2 decrease in estimated GFR. The prevalence of BAC in CKD was increased in each decade of age over 49 years. Conclusions: CKD is an independent risk factor for medial arterial calcification.",2012 Feb
738,"Fong J,Khan A",Hypocalcémie: Mises à jour dans le diagnostic et la prise en charge en soins primaires.,"Objectif: Présenter aux médecins de famille une approche fondée sur des données probantes pour le diagnostic et la prise en charge de l’hypocalcémie. Qualité des données: On a fait une recherche documentaire dans MEDLINE et EMBASE pour cerner des articles parus de 2000 à 2010 portant sur le diagnostic et la prise en charge de l’hypocalcémie. Les niveaux des données (de I à III) sont indiqués, le cas échéant et, dans la plupart des études, les données se situent aux niveaux II et III. On a aussi examiné les références des ouvrages appropriés pour trouver des articles pertinents. Message principal: L’hypocalcémie est habituellement attribuable à des taux insuffisants d’hormones parathyroïdes ou de vitamine D ou à une résistance à ces hormones. Le traitement consiste surtout à administrer des suppléments de calcium et de vitamine D par voie orale, ainsi que de magnésium s’il y a carence. On peut intensifier davantage le traitement avec des diurétiques thiazidiques, des chélateurs de phosphore et un régime à faible teneur en sel et en phosphore quand on traite une hypocalcémie secondaire à une hypoparathyroïdie. Une carence en calcium aiguë et dangereuse pour la vie exige un traitement au moyen de calcium intraveineux. Les recommandations thérapeutiques actuelles se fondent largement sur l’opinion d’experts cliniciens et de rapports de cas publiés, car il n’y a pas suffisamment de données probantes disponibles tirées d’études cliniques contrôlées. Au nombre des complications des thérapies actuelles, on peut mentionner l’hypercalciurie, la néphrocalcinose, l’insuffisance rénale et la calcification des tissus mous. La thérapie actuelle est limitée par les fluctuations du calcium sérique. Quoique ces complications soient bien reconnues, les effets sur le bien-être général, l’humeur, la fonction cognitive et la qualité de vie, ainsi que les risques de complications, n’ont pas été adéquatement étudiés. Conclusion: Les médecins de famille jouent un rôle central dans l’éducation des patients à propos de la prise en charge à long terme et des complications de l’hypocalcémie. À l’heure actuelle, la prise en charge est sous-optimale et marquée par des fluctuations dans le calcium sérique et l’absence d’une thérapie de remplacement des hormones parathyroïdes homologuée pour l’hypoparathyroïdie.",2012 Feb
739,"Fong J,Khan A",Hypocalcemia: Updates in diagnosis and management for primary care.,"Objective: To provide family physicians with an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of hypocalcemia. Quality of evidence: MEDLINE and EMBASE articles from 2000 to 2010 were searched, with a focus on the diagnosis and management of hypocalcemia. Levels of evidence (I to III) were cited where appropriate, with most studies providing level II or III evidence. References of pertinent papers were also searched for relevant articles. Main message: Chronic hypocalcemia is commonly due to inadequate levels of parathyroid hormone or vitamin D, or due to resistance to these hormones. Treatment focuses on oral calcium and vitamin D supplements, as well as magnesium if deficiency is present. Treatment can be further intensified with thiazide diuretics, phosphate binders, and a low-salt and low-phosphorus diet when treating hypocalcemia secondary to hypoparathyroidism. Acute and life-threatening calcium deficit requires treatment with intravenous calcium. The current treatment recommendations are largely based on expert clinical opinion and published case reports, as adequately controlled clinical trial data are not currently available. Complications of current therapies for hypoparathyroidism include hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, renal impairment, and soft tissue calcification. Current therapy is limited by serum calcium fluctuations. Although these complications are well recognized, the effects of therapy on overall well-being, mood, cognition, and quality of life, as well as the risk of complications, have not been adequately studied. Conclusion: Family physicians play a crucial role in educating patients about the long-term management and complications of hypocalcemia. Currently, management is suboptimal and marked by fluctuations in serum calcium and a lack of approved parathyroid hormone replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism.",2012 Feb

The Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade on histological sections is a well-established tool to guide selection of adjuvant systemic therapy. Grade evaluation is possible on cytology smears to avoid and minimize the morbidity associated with overtreatment of lower grade tumors. Aim:: The aim was to test the hypothesis whether breast FNA from the peripheral portion of the lesion is representative of Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grade on histopathology as compared to FNA from the central portion. Materials and Methods:: Fine-needle aspirates and subsequent tissue specimens from 45 women with ductal carcinoma (not otherwise specified) were studied. FNAs were performed under ultrasound guidance from the central as well as the peripheral third of the lesion for each case avoiding areas of necrosis/calcification. The SBR grading was compared on alcohol fixed aspirates and tissue sections for each case. Results:: Comparative analysis of SBR grade on aspirates from the peripheral portion and histopathology by the Pearson chi-square test (χ2 =78.00) showed that it was statistically significant (P<0.001) with 93% concordance. Lower mitotic score on aspirates from the peripheral portion was observed in only 4 out of 45 (9%) cases. The results of the Pearson chi-square test (χ2 = 75.824) with statistically significant (P=0.000). Conclusion:: This prospective study shows that FNA smears from the peripheral portion of the lesion are representative of the grading performed on the corresponding histopathological sections. It is possible to score and grade by SBR system on FNA smears.",2012
741,"Zysk AM,Brankov JG,Wernick MN,Anastasio MA",Adaptation of a clustered lumpy background model for task-based image quality assessment in x-ray phase-contrast mammography.,"Purpose: Since the introduction of clinical x-ray phase-contrast mammography (PCM), a technique that exploits refractive-index variations to create edge enhancement at tissue boundaries, a number of optimization studies employing physical image-quality metrics have been performed. Ideally, task-based assessment of PCM would have been conducted with human readers. These studies have been limited, however, in part due to the large parameter-space of PCM system configurations and the difficulty of employing expert readers for large-scale studies. It has been proposed that numerical observers can be used to approximate the statistical performance of human readers, thus enabling the study of task-based performance over a large parameter-space.Methods: Methods are presented for task-based image quality assessment of PCM images with a numerical observer, the most significant of which is an adapted lumpy background from the conventional mammography literature that accounts for the unique wavefield propagation physics of PCM image formation and will be used with a numerical observer to assess image quality. These methods are demonstrated by performing a PCM task-based image quality study using a numerical observer. This study employs a signal-known-exactly, background-known-statistically Bayesian ideal observer method to assess the detectability of a calcification object in PCM images when the anode spot size and calcification diameter are varied.Results: The first realistic model for the structured background in PCM images has been introduced. A numerical study demonstrating the use of this background model has compared PCM and conventional mammography detection of calcification objects. The study data confirm the strong PCM calcification detectability dependence on anode spot size. These data can be used to balance the trade-off between enhanced image quality and the potential for motion artifacts that comes with use of a reduced spot size and increased exposure time.Conclusions: A method has been presented for the incorporation of structured breast background data into task-based numerical observer assessment of PCM images. The method adapts conventional background simulation techniques to the wavefield propagation physics necessary for PCM imaging. This method is demonstrated with a simple detection task.",2012 Feb
742,"Karwowski W,Naumnik B,Szczepański M,Myśliwiec M",The mechanism of vascular calcification – a systematic review.,"Calcification of vessels reduces their elasticity, affecting hemodynamic parameters of the cardiovascular system. The development of arterial hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, ischemic heart disease or peripheral arterial disease significantly increases mortality in patients over 60 years of age. Stage of advancement and the extent of accumulation of calcium deposits in vessel walls are key risk factors of ischemic events.Vascular calcification is an active and complex process that involves numerous mechanisms responsible for calcium depositions in arterial walls. They lead to increase in arterial stiffness and in pulse wave velocity, which in turn increases cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.In-depth study and thorough understanding of vascular calcification mechanisms may be crucial for establishing an effective vasculoprotective therapy.The aim of this study was to present a comprehensive survey of current state-of-the-art research into the impact of metabolic and hormonal disorders on development of vascular calcification.Due to strong resemblance to the processes occurring in bone tissue, drugs used for osteoporosis treatment (calcitriol, estradiol, bisphosphonates) may interfere with the processes occurring in the vessel wall. On the other hand, drugs used to treat cardiovascular problems (statins, angiotensin convertase inhibitors, warfarin, heparins) may have an effect on bone tissue metabolism. Efforts to optimally control calcium and phosphate concentrations are also beneficial for patients with end-stage renal disease, for whom vessel calcification remains a major problem.",2012
743,"Liu J,Ning R,Cai W,Benitez RB",Enhancement of Breast Calcification Visualization and Detection Using a Modified PG Method in Cone Beam Breast CT.,"Cone Beam Breast CT is a promising diagnostic modality in breast imaging. Its isotropic 3D spatial resolution enhances the characterization of micro-calcifications in breasts that might not be easily distinguishable in mammography. However, due to dose level considerations, it is beneficial to further enhance the visualization of calcifications in Cone Beam Breast CT images that might be masked by noise. In this work, the Papoulis-Gerchberg method was modified and implemented in Cone Beam Breast CT images to improve the visualization and detectability of calcifications. First, the PG method was modified and applied to the projections acquired during the scanning process; its effects on the reconstructed images were analyzed by measuring the Modulation Transfer Function and the Noise Power Spectrum. Second, Cone Beam Breast CT images acquired at different dose levels were pre-processed using this technique to enhance the visualization of calcification. Finally, a computer-aided diagnostic algorithm was utilized to evaluate the efficacy of this method to improve calcification detectability. The results demonstrated that this technique can effectively improve image quality by improving the Modulation Transfer Function with a minor increase in noise level. Consequently, the visualization and detectability of calcifications were improved in Cone Beam Breast CT images. This technique was also proved to be useful in reducing the x-ray dose without degrading visualization and detectability of calcifications.",2012 Jan 1
744,Rowe PSN,"Regulation of Bone–Renal Mineral and Energy Metabolism: The PHEX, FGF23, DMP1, MEPE ASARM Pathway.","More than 300 million years ago, vertebrates emerged from the vast oceans to conquer gravity and the dry land. With this transition, new adaptations occurred that included ingenious changes in reproduction, waste secretion, and bone physiology. One new innovation, the egg shell, contained an ancestral protein (ovocleidin-116) that likely first appeared with the dinosaurs and was preserved through the theropod lineage in modern birds and reptiles. Ovocleidin-116 is an avian homolog of matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) and belongs to a group of proteins called short integrin-binding ligand-interacting glycoproteins (SIBLINGs). These proteins are all localized to a defined region on chromosome 5q in mice and chromosome 4q in humans. A unifying feature of SIBLING proteins is an acidic serine aspartate-rich MEPE-associated motif (ASARM). Recent research has shown that the ASARM motif and the released ASARM peptide have regulatory roles in mineralization (bone and teeth), phosphate regulation, vascularization, soft-tissue calcification, osteoclastogenesis, mechanotransduction, and fat energy metabolism. The MEPE ASARM motif and peptide are physiological substrates for PHEX, a zinc metalloendopeptidase. Defects in PHEX are responsible for X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (HYP). There is evidence that PHEX interacts with another ASARM motif containing the SIBLING protein, dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1). DMP1 mutations cause bone and renal defects that are identical with the defects caused by a loss of PHEX function. This results in autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR). In both HYP and ARHR, increased FGF23 expression plays a major role in the disease and in autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), FGF23 half-life is increased by activating mutations. ASARM peptide administration in vitro and in vivo also induces increased FGF23 expression. FGF23 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of cytokines, which surfaced 500 million years ago with the boney fish (i.e., teleosts) that do not contain SIBLING proteins. In terrestrial vertebrates, FGF23, like SIBLING proteins, is expressed in the osteocyte. The boney fish, however, are an-osteocytic, so a physiological bone-renal link with FGF23 and the SIBLINGs was cemented when life ventured from the oceans to the land during the Triassic period, approximately 300 million years ago. This link has been revealed by recent research that indicates a competitive displacement of a PHEX–DMP1 interaction by an ASARM peptide that leads to increased FGF23 expression. This review discusses the new discoveries that reveal a novel PHEX, DMP1, MEPE, ASARM peptide, and FGF23 bone-renal pathway. This pathway impacts not only bone formation, bone-renal mineralization, and renal phosphate homeostasis but also energy metabolism. The study of this new pathway is relevant for developing therapies for several diseases: bone–teeth mineral loss disorders, renal osteodystrophy, chronic kidney disease and bone mineralization disorders (CKD-MBD), end-stage renal diseases, ectopic arterial-calcification, cardiovascular disease renal calcification, diabetes, and obesity.",2012
745,"Barascuk N,Ganz M,Nielsen M,Register TC,Rasmussen LM,Karsdal MA,Christiansen C",Abdominal aortic calcification quantified by the Morphological Atherosclerotic Calcification Distribution (MACD) index is associated with features of the metabolic syndrome.,"Background: Abdominal aortic calcifications (AAC) predict cardiovascular mortality. A new scoring model for AAC, the Morphological Atherosclerotic Calcification Distribution (MACD) index may contribute with additional information to the commonly used Aortic Calcification Severity (AC24) score, when predicting death from cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this study we investigated associations of MACD and AC24 with traditional metabolic-syndrome associated risk factors at baseline and after 8.3 years follow-up, to identify biological parameters that may account for the differential performance of these indices. Methods: Three hundred and eight healthy women aged 48 to 76 years, were followed for 8.3 ± 0.3 years. AAC was quantified using lumbar radiographs. Baseline data included age, weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, and glucose levels. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to test for relationships. Results: At baseline and across all patients, MACD correlated with blood glucose (r2 = 0.1, P< 0.001) and to a lesser, but significant extent with traditional risk factors (p < 0.01) of CVD. In the longitudinal analysis of correlations between baseline biological parameters and the follow-up calcification assessment using radiographs we found LDL-cholesterol, HDL/LDL, and the ApoB/ApoA ratio significantly associated with the MACD (P< 0.01). In a subset of patients presenting with calcification at both baseline and at follow-up, all cholesterol levels were significantly associated with the MACD (P< 0.01) index. AC24 index was not correlated with blood parameters. Conclusion: Patterns of calcification identified by the MACD, but not the AC24 index, appear to contain useful biological information perhaps explaining part of the improved identification of risk of cardiovascular death of the MACD index. Correlations of MACD but not the AC24 with glucose levels at baseline suggest that hyperglycemia may contribute to unique patterns of calcification indicated by the MACD.",2011
746,"Sahiner B,Chan HP,Hadjiiski LM,Helvie MA,Wei J,Zhou C,Lu Y",Computer-aided detection of clustered microcalcifications in digital breast tomosynthesis: A 3D approach.,"Purpose: To design a computer-aided detection (CADe) system for clustered microcalcifications in reconstructed digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) volumes and to perform a preliminary evaluation of the CADe system.Methods: IRB approval and informed consent were obtained in this study. A data set of two-view DBT of 72 breasts containing microcalcification clusters was collected from 72 subjects who were scheduled to undergo breast biopsy. Based on tissue sampling results, 17 cases had breast cancer and 55 were benign. A separate data set of two-view DBT of 38 breasts free of clustered microcalcifications from 38 subjects was collected to independently estimate the number of false-positives (FPs) generated by the CADe system. A radiologist experienced in breast imaging marked the biopsied cluster of microcalcifications with a 3D bounding box using all available clinical and imaging information. A CADe system was designed to detect microcalcification clusters in the reconstructed volume. The system consisted of prescreening, clustering, and false-positive reduction stages. In the prescreening stage, the conspicuity of microcalcification-like objects was increased by an enhancement-modulated 3D calcification response function. An iterative thresholding and 3D object growing method was used to detect cluster seed objects, which were used as potential centers of microcalcification clusters. In the cluster detection stage, microcalcification candidates were identified using a second iterative thresholding procedure, which was applied to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhanced image voxels with a positive calcification response. Starting with each cluster seed object as the initial cluster center, a dynamic clustering algorithm formed a cluster candidate by including microcalcification candidates within a 3D neighborhood of the cluster seed object that satisfied the clustering criteria. The number, size, and SNR of the microcalcifications in a cluster candidate and the cluster shape were used to reduce the number of FPs.Results: The prescreening stage detected a cluster seed object in 94% of the biopsied microcalcification clusters at a threshold of 100 cluster seed objects per DBT volume. After clustering, the detection sensitivity was 90% at 15 marks per DBT volume. After FP reduction, at 85% sensitivity, the average number of FPs estimated using the data set containing microcalcification clusters was 3.8 per DBT volume, and that estimated using the data set free of microcalcification clusters was 3.4. The detection performance for malignant microcalcification clusters was superior to that for benign clusters.Conclusions: Our study indicates the feasibility of the 3D approach to the detection of clustered microcalcifications in DBT and that the newly designed enhancement-modulated 3D calcification response function is promising for prescreening. Further work is needed to assess the generalizability of our approach and to improve its performance.",2012 Jan

Hypercalcemia is common in patients with ATL. These patients rarely develop metastatic calcification and acute pancreatitis. The underlying pathogenesis of this condition is osteoclast hyperactivity with associated overproduction of parathyroid hormone-related protein, which results in hypercalcemia in association with bone demineralization. The discovery of the osteoclast differentiation factor receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), its receptor RANK, and its decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG), enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms of ATL-associated hypercalcemia. Macrophage inflammatory protein-1-α, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 are important molecules that enhance the migration and differentiation of osteoclasts and the associated enhanced production of RANKL for osteoblast formation. In this paper, we focus on metastatic calcification and acute pancreatitis in ATL, highlighting recent advances in the understanding of the molecular role of the RANKL/RANK/OPG system including its interaction with various cytokines and calciotropic hormones in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis for bone resorption in hypercalcemic ATL patients.",2012

Endochondral chondrocytes undergo sequences of cell division, matrix secretion, cell hypertrophy, apoptosis, and matrix calcification/mineralisation. In this study, two critical steps of endochondral bone formation, the deposition of collagen X-rich matrix and blood vessel attraction/invasion, were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Fourteen multiple osteochondromas and six secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas occurring in patients with multiple osteochondromas were studied and compared to epiphyseal growth plate samples. Mutation analysis showed all studied patients (expect one) to harbour a germ-line mutations in either EXT1 or EXT2. Here, we described that homozygous mutations in EXT1/EXT2, which are causative for osteochondroma formation, are likely to affect terminal chondrocyte differentiation and vascularisation in the osteocartilaginous interface. Contrastingly, terminal chondrocyte differentiation and vascularisation seem to be unaffected in secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. In addition, osteochondromas with high vascular density displayed a higher proliferation rate. A similar apoptotic rate was observed in osteochondromas and secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas. Recently, it has been shown that cells with functional EXT1 and EXT2 are outnumbering EXT1/EXT2 mutated cells in secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas. This might explain the increased type X collagen production and blood vessel attraction in these malignant tumours.",2012

750,"Hunter LW,Lieske JC,Tran NV,Miller VM",The association of Matrix Gla protein isomers with calcification in capsules surrounding silicone breast implants.,"Implanted silicone medical prostheses induce a dynamic sequence of histologic events in adjacent tissue resulting in the formation of a fibrotic peri-prosthetic capsule. In some cases, capsular calcification occurs, requiring surgical intervention. In this study we investigated capsules from silicone gel-filled breast prostheses to test the hypothesis that this calcification might be regulated by the small vitamin K-dependent protein, matrix Gla protein (MGP), a potent inhibitor of arterial calcification, or by Fetuin-A, a hepatocyte-derived glycoprotein also implicated as a regulator of pathologic calcification. Immunolocalization studies of explanted capsular tissue, using conformation-specific antibodies, identified the mineralization-protective γ-carboxylated MGP isomer (cMGP) within cells of uncalcified capsules, whereas the non-functional undercarboxylated isomer (uMGP) was typically absent. Both were upregulated in calcific capsules and co-localized with mineral plaque and adjacent fibers. Synovial-like metaplasia was present in one uncalcified capsule in which MGP species were differentially localized within the pseudosynovium. Fetuin-A was localized to cells within uncalcified capsules and to mineral deposits within calcific capsules. The osteoinductive cytokine bone morphogenic protein-2 localized to collagen fibers in uncalcified capsules. These findings demonstrate that MGP, in its vitamin K-activated conformer, may represent a pharmacological target to sustain the health of the peri-prosthetic tissue which encapsulates silicone breast implants as well as other implanted silicone medical devices.",2011 Nov

A putative binding site for microRNA-367 (miR-367) exists in the 3′UTR of RYR3, and a genetic variant, rs1044129 A→G, is present in this binding region. We confirmed that miR-367 regulates the expression of a reporter gene driven by the RYR3 3′UTR and that the regulation was affected by the RYR3 genotype. A thermodynamic model based on base pairing and the secondary structure of the RYR3 mRNA and miR-367 miRNA showed that miR-367 had a higher binding affinity for the A genotype than for the G genotype. The rs1044129 SNP was genotyped in 1,532 breast cancer cases and 1,600 healthy Chinese women. The results showed that compared with the AA genotype, G was a risk genotype for breast cancer development and was also associated with breast cancer calcification and poor survival. Thus, rs1044129 is a unique SNP that resides in a miRNA-gene regulatory loop that affects breast cancer risk, calcification, and survival.",2011 Aug 16

Despite the high prevalence and mortality associated with CAS, little is known about its pathogenetic mechanisms. Characterized by progressive dystrophic calcification of the valve leaflets, the early stages of aortic valve degeneration are similar to the active inflammatory process of atherosclerosis including endothelial disruption, inflammatory cell infiltration, lipid deposition, neo-vascularization and calcification. In the vascular system, the endothelium is an important regulator of physiological and pathological conditions; however, the contribution of endothelial dysfunction to valvular degeneration at the cellular and molecular level has received little attention. Endothelial cell (EC) activation and neo-vascularization of the cusps characterizes all stages of aortic valvular degeneration from aortic sclerosis to aortic stenosis. Here we reported the role of osteopontin (OPN) in the regulation of EC activation in vitro and in excised tissue from CAS patients and controls. OPN is an important pro-angiogenic factor in several pathologies. High levels of OPN have been demonstrated in both tissue and plasma of patients with aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis. The characterization of valvular ECs as a cellular target for OPN will help us uncover the pathogenesis of aortic valve degeneration and stenosis, opening new perspectives for the prevention and therapy of this prevalent disease.",2011 Aug

The inability of this transporter to secrete its substrate into the circulation is the likely cause of PXE. Vitamin K plays a role in the regulation of mineralization processes as a co-factor in the carboxylation of calcification inhibitors such as Matrix Gla Protein (MGP). Vitamin K precursor or a conjugated form has been proposed as potential substrate(s) for ABCC6. We investigated whether an enriched diet of vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 (MK4) could stop or slow the disease progression in Abcc6-/- mice. Abcc6-/- mice were placed on a diet of either vitamin K1 or MK4 at 5 or 100 mg/kg at prenatal, 3 weeks or 3 months of age. Disease progression was quantified by measuring the calcium content of one side of the mouse muzzle skin and histological staining for calcium of the opposing side. Raising the vitamin K1 or MK4 content of the diet increased the concentration of circulating MK4 in the serum. However, this increase did not significantly affect the MGP carboxylation status or reduce its abnormal abundance, the total calcium content or the pathologic calcification in the whiskers of the 3 treatment groups compared to controls. Our findings showed that raising the dietary intake of vitamin K1 or MK4 was not beneficial in the treatment of PXE and suggested that the availability of vitamin K may not be a limiting factor in this pathology.",2011 Jun 1
755,"Toma I,McCaffrey TA",Transforming growth factor-β and atherosclerosis: interwoven atherogenic and atheroprotective aspects.,"Age-related progression of cardiovascular disease is by far the largest health problem in the US and involves vascular damage, progressive vascular fibrosis and the accumulation of lipid-rich atherosclerotic lesions. Advanced lesions can restrict flow to key organs and can trigger occlusive thrombosis resulting in a stroke or myocardial infarction. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a major orchestrator of the fibroproliferative response to tissue damage. In the early stages of repair, TGF-β is released from platelets and activated from matrix reservoirs; it then stimulates the chemotaxis of repair cells, modulates immunity and inflammation and induces matrix production. At later stages, it negatively regulates fibrosis through its strong antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on fibrotic cells. In advanced lesions, TGF-β might be important in arterial calcification, commonly referred to as “hardening of the arteries”. Because TGF-β can signal through multiple pathways, namely the SMADs, a MAPK pathway and the Rho/ROCK pathways, selective defects in TGF-β signaling can disrupt otherwise coordinated pathways of tissue regeneration. TGF-β is known to control cell proliferation, cell migration, matrix synthesis, wound contraction, calcification and the immune response, all being major components of the atherosclerotic process. However, many of the effects of TGF-β are essential to normal tissue repair and thus, TGF-β is often thought to be “atheroprotective”. The present review attempts to parse systematically the known effects of TGF-β on both the major risk factors for atherosclerosis and to isolate the role of TGF-β in the many component pathways involved in atherogenesis.",2012 Jan
756,Rabkin SW,Endothelin but Not Angiotensin II May Mediate Hypertension-Induced Coronary Vascular Calcification in Chronic Kidney Disease.,"To understand the relationship between putative neurohormonal factors operative in hypertension and coronary artery calcification (CAC), the relevant cellular actions of angiotensin (Ang II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are reviewed. There is compelling evidence to implicate ET-1 in CAC. ET-1 increases phosphate transport with a 42 to 73% increase in Vmax. Increased cellular phosphate may induce CAC through increased Ca x phosphate product, transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into a bone-producing phenotype or cell apoptosis that releases procalcific substances. ET-1 is increased in several models of vascular calcification. ET-1 inhibits inhibitors of calcification, matrix Gla and osteoprotegerin, while enhancing pro-calcific factors such as BMP-2 and osteopontin. In contrast, Ang II inhibits phosphate transport decreasing Vmax by 38% and increases matrix Gla. Ang II also stimulates bone resorption. Vascular calcification is reduced by ET-1 A receptor antagonists and to a greater extent than angiotensin receptor blockade although both agents reduce blood pressure.",2011

Recently, we isolated a novel oncogene eIF-5A2 within the 3q26 region. Functional study has demonstrated the oncogenic role of eIF-5A2 in the initiation and progression of human cancers. In the present study, we aim to investigate the physiological and pathological effect of eIF-5A2 in an eIF-5A2 transgenic mouse model. Methods: An eIF-5A2 transgenic mouse model was generated using human eIF-5A2 cDNA. The eIF-5A2 transgenic mice were characterized by histological and immunohistochemistry analyses. The aging phenotypes were further characterized by wound healing, bone X-ray imaging and calcification analysis. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) were isolated to further investigate molecular mechanism of eIF-5A2 in aging. Results: Instead of resulting in spontaneous tumor formation, overexpression of eIF-5A2 accelerated the aging process in adult transgenic mice. This included decreased growth rate and body weight, shortened life span, kyphosis, osteoporosis, delay of wound healing and ossification. Investigation of the correlation between cellular senescence and aging showed that cellular senescence is not required for the aging phenotypes in eIF-5A2 mice. Interestingly, we found that activation of eIF-5A2 repressed p19 level and therefore destabilized p53 in transgenic mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells. This subsequently allowed for the accumulation of chromosomal instability, such as errors in cell dividing during metaphase and anaphase. Additionally, a significantly increase in number of aneuploidy cells (p < 0.05) resulted from an increase in the incidences of misaligned and lagging chromosomal materials, anaphase bridges, and micronuclei in the transgenic mice. Conclusion: These observations suggest that eIF-5A2 mouse models could accelerate organismal aging by increasing chromosome instability.",2011
758,"Hung TT,Chan J,Russell PJ,Power CA",Zoledronic Acid Preserves Bone Structure and Increases Survival but Does Not Limit Tumour Incidence in a Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis Model.,"Background: The bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid (ZOL), can inhibit osteoclasts leading to decreased osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity in bone. Here, we used a mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic murine model of bone-metastatic prostate cancer, RM1(BM), to determine how inhibiting osteolysis with ZOL affects the ability of these cells to establish metastases in bone, the integrity of the tumour-bearing bones and the survival of the tumour-bearing mice. Methods: The model involves intracardiac injection for arterial dissemination of the RM1(BM) cells in C57BL/6 mice. ZOL treatment was given via subcutaneous injections on days 0, 4, 8 and 12, at 20 and 100 µg/kg doses. Bone integrity was assessed by micro-computed tomography and histology with comparison to untreated mice. The osteoclast and osteoblast activity was determined by measuring serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP 5b) and osteocalcin, respectively. Mice were euthanased according to predetermined criteria and survival was assessed using Kaplan Meier plots. Findings: Micro-CT and histological analysis showed that treatment of mice with ZOL from the day of intracardiac injection of RM1(BM) cells inhibited tumour-induced bone lysis, maintained bone volume and reduced the calcification of tumour-induced endochondral osteoid material. ZOL treatment also led to a decreased serum osteocalcin and TRAP 5b levels. Additionally, treated mice showed increased survival compared to vehicle treated controls. However, ZOL treatment did not inhibit the cells ability to metastasise to bone as the number of bone-metastases was similar in both treated and untreated mice. Conclusions: ZOL treatment provided significant benefits for maintaining the integrity of tumour-bearing bones and increased the survival of tumour bearing mice, though it did not prevent establishment of bone-metastases in this model. From the mechanistic view, these observations confirm that tumour-induced bone lysis is not a requirement for establishment of these bone tumours.",2011
759,"Mahoney MC,Meganathan K",False Positive Marks on Unsuspicious Screening Mammography with Computer-Aided Detection.,"The contribution of computer-aided detection (CAD) systems as an interpretive aid in screening mammography can be hampered by a high rate of false positive detections. Specificity, false positive rate, and ease of dismissing false positive marks from two CAD systems are retrospectively evaluated. One hundred screening mammographic studies with a BI-RADS assessment code of 1 or 2 and at least 2-year normal mammographic follow-up were retrospectively reviewed using two CAD systems. Breast density, CAD marks, and radiologist's ease of dismissing false positive marks were recorded. Specificities from the two CAD versions considering all marks were 23% and 15% (p value = 0.07); mass marks, 35% and 17% (p value < 0.01); and calcification marks 62% and 75% (p value = 0.01). The two CAD versions did not differ regarding mean and median marks per case for all marks (2.3, 2.0 and 2.3, 2.0, p value = 0.65) or mass marks (1.6, 1.0 and 1.8, 2.0, p value = 0.15), but differed for calcification marks (0.8, 0 and 0.5, 0, p value < 0.01). Slightly higher specificity and fewer marks per case observed in dense breasts did not reach statistical significance. The reviewing radiologist classified most marks from both CAD systems (84% and 88%) as very easy/easy to dismiss. The two CAD versions had small differences in specificity and false positive marks. Differences, although not statistically significant, in specificities and false positive rates between dense and non-dense breasts warrant further research. Most false positive marks are easily dismissed and should not affect clinical performance.",2011 Oct

We recently described the first robust animal model of breast cancer microcalcification. In this study, we hypothesized that high-resolution computed tomography (CT) could potentially detect the genesis of a single microcalcification in vivo and quantify its growth over time. Using a commercial CT scanner, we systematically optimized acquisition and reconstruction parameters. Two ray-tracing image reconstruction algorithms were tested, a voxel-driven “fast” cone beam algorithm (FCBA) and a detector-driven “exact” cone beam algorithm (ECBA). By optimizing acquisition and reconstruction parameters, we were able to achieve a resolution of 104 µm full-width at half maximum (FWHM). At an optimal detector sampling frequency, ECBA provided a 28 µm (21%) FWHM improvement in resolution over FCBA. In vitro, we were able to image a single 300 µm by 100 µm hydroxyapatite crystal. In a syngeneic rat model of breast cancer, we were able to detect the genesis of a single microcalcification in vivo and follow its growth longitudinally over weeks. Taken together, this study provides an in vivo “gold standard” for the development of calcification-specific contrast agents and a model system for studying the mechanism of breast cancer microcalcification.",2011 Aug
761,Kumar VA,Calcific Uremic Arteriolopathy: An Underrecognized Entity.,"Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), or calciphylaxis, is an uncommon and underrecognized disease that often occurs in the setting of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. It is characterized by small-vessel calcification, although many times it is associated with normal serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone. The lesions appear as necrotic eschars, ulcerations, indurated nodules, and dry gangrene and are usually very painful. Diagnosis is based on clinical judgment and recognition of characteristic skin lesions. Biopsy can be performed but may be complicated by poor wound healing. Treatment of CUA involves rigorous wound care, strict control of mineral metabolism with avoidance of calcium and vitamin D analogs, and pain control. Other treatment options include sodium thiosulfate, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, daily hemodialysis using low-calcium dialysate, and bisphosphonates. Even with treatment, CUA is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The patient in the case reported here had characteristic skin lesions and several risk factors for CUA, but diagnosis was delayed.",2011 Spring

Using our rat model of uremia-induced reversible aortic valve calcification, we assessed the role of apoptosis and survival pathways in that disease. We also explored the effects of raloxifene, an estrogen receptor modulator, on valvular calcification. Gene array analysis was performed in aortic valves obtained from three groups of rats (n = 7 rats/group): calcified valves obtained from rats fed with uremic diet, valves after calcification resolution following diet cessation, and control. In addition, four groups of rats (n = 10 rats/group) were used to evaluate the effect of raloxifene in aortic valve calcification: three groups as mentioned above and a fourth group fed with the uremic diet that also received daily raloxifene. Evaluation included imaging, histology, and antigen expression analysis. Gene array results showed that the majority of the altered expressed genes were in diet group valves. Most apoptosis-related genes were changed in a proapoptotic direction in calcified valves. Apoptosis and decreases in several survival pathways were confirmed in calcified valves. Resolution of aortic valve calcification was accompanied by decreased apoptosis and upregulation of survival pathways. Imaging and histology demonstrated that raloxifene significantly decreased aortic valve calcification. In conclusion, downregulation of several survival pathways and apoptosis are involved in the pathogenesis of aortic valve calcification. The beneficial effect of raloxifene in valve calcification is related to apoptosis modulation. This novel observation is important for developing remedies for aortic valve calcification in patients with renal failure.",2011 May

Existing Runx2 mutant and transgenic mouse models do not allow the necessary control of Runx2 expression to understand its functions in different tissues. We generated conditional, doxycyline-inducible, triple transgenic mice (CMV-Cre;ROSA26-neoflox/+-rtTA;Tet-O-Runx2) to investigate the effects of wide spread overexpression of Runx2. Osteoblasts isolated from CMV-Cre;ROSA26-neoflox/+-rtTA; Tet-O-Runx2 mice demonstrated a dose-dependent effect of doxycycline to stimulate Runx2 transgene expression. Doxycycline administration to CMV-Cre;ROSA26-neoflox/+-rtTA;Tet-O-Runx2 mice induced Runx2 transgene expression in all tissues tested, with the highest levels observed in kidney, ovary, and bone. Runx2 overexpression resulted in deceased body size and reduced viability. With regard to bone, Runx2 overexpressing mice paradoxically displayed profound osteopenia and diminished osteogenesis. Induced expression of Runx2 in extraskeletal tissues resulted in ectopic calcification and induction of the osteogenic program in a limited number of tissues, including lung and muscle. In addition, the triple transgenic mice showed evidence of a myeloproliferative disorder and an apparent inhibition of lymphocyte development. Thus, overexpression of Runx2 both within and outside of the skeleton can have diverse biological effects. Use of tissue specific Cre mice will allow this model to be used to conditionally and inducibly overexpress Runx2 in different tissues and provide a means to study the post-natal tissue- and cell context-dependent functions of Runx2.",2011 Feb
765,"Duhn V,D'Orsi ET,Johnson S,D'Orsi CJ,Adams AL,O'Neill WC",Breast Arterial Calcification: A Marker of Medial Vascular Calcification in Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Background and objectives: Because previous studies have not distinguished between intimal (atherosclerotic) and medial vascular calcification, the prevalence and clinical significance of either condition in chronic or end-stage kidney disease (CKD or ESKD) are unknown. We hypothesized that breast arterial calcification (BAC) is exclusively medial and that mammography can serve as a useful marker of generalized medial calcification in CKD and ESKD. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Arterial calcification was identified histologically in breast tissue or visually in mammograms and radiographs of extremities from patients with CKD or ESKD. Results: Medial calcification but no intimal calcification was present in all 16 specimens from patients with CKD or ESKD. In 71 women with ESKD, BAC was present on mammograms in 63% compared with 17% in women without renal insufficiency matched for age, race, and diabetes (P < 0.001). Age and ESKD duration were significant, independent predictors of BAC. BAC was also present in 36% of mammograms from the same patients performed 5.5 ± 0.7 years before the onset of ESKD (P < 0.05 versus control) but in only 14% of patients with stage 3 CKD. Comparison of mammograms and extremity radiographs revealed that BAC was present in over 90% of patients with peripheral arterial calcification (PAC), and PAC was observed in less than 6% of patients without BAC. Conclusions: BAC is a specific and useful marker of medial vascular calcification in CKD, and its prevalence is markedly increased in ESKD and advanced CKD.",2011 Feb
766,"Zeng J,Yang F,Zhang W,Gong Q,Du Y,Ling J",Association between dental pulp stones and calcifying nanoparticles.,"The etiology of dental pulp stones, one type of extraskeletal calcification disease, remains elusive to date. Calcifying nanoparticles (CNPs), formerly referred to as nanobacteria, were reported to be one etiological factor in a number of extraskeletal calcification diseases. We hypothesized that CNPs are involved in the calcification of the dental pulp tissue, and therefore investigated the link between CNPs and dental pulp stones. Sixty-five freshly collected dental pulp stones, each from a different patient, were analyzed. Thirteen of the pulp stones were examined for the existence of CNPs in situ by immunohistochemical staining (IHS), indirect immunofluorescence staining (IIFS), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The remaining 52 pulp stones were used for isolation and cultivation of CNPs; the cultured CNPs were identified and confirmed via their shape and growth characteristics. Among the dental pulp stones examined in situ, 84.6% of the tissue samples staines positive for CNPs antigen by IHS; the corresponding rate by IIFS was 92.3 %. In 88.2% of the cultured samples, CNPs were isolated and cultivated successfully. The CNPs were visible under TEM as 200–400 nm diameter spherical particles surrounded by a compact crust. CNPs could be detected and isolated from a high percentage of dental pulp stones, suggesting that CNPs might play an important role in the calcification of dental pulp.",2011 2011

Methods: The retrospective evaluation by two observers of volumes of 71 thyroid nodules (55 benign, 16 cancers) was performed using a new TSVR technique. Dedicated 4D ultrasound scanner with an automatic 6-12 MHz 4D probe was used. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata v. 8.2. Results: Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that independent risk factors of thyroid cancers identified by 3D ultrasound include: (a) ill-defined borders of the nodule on MPR presentation, (b) a lobulated shape of the nodule in the c-plane and (c) a density of central vessels in the nodule within the minimal or maximal ranges. Combination of features provided sensitivity 100% and specificity 60-69% for thyroid cancer.Calcification/microcalcification-like echogenic foci on 3D ultrasound proved not to be a risk factor of thyroid cancer.Storage of the 3D data of the whole nodules enabled subsequent evaluation of new parameters and with new rendering algorithms. Conclusions: Our results indicate that 3D ultrasound is a practical and reproducible method for the evaluation of thyroid nodules. 3D ultrasound stores volumes comprising the whole lesion or organ. Future detailed evaluations of the data are possible, looking for features that were not fully appreciated at the time of collection or applying new algorithms for volume rendering in order to gain important information. Three-dimensional ultrasound data could be included in thyroid cancer databases. Further multicenter large scale studies are warranted.",2011

On the early and delayed positron emission tomography images, size, attenuation, maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) and retention indices (RI) were recorded for lymph node characterization. Results:: The mean SUV on the early and delayed scan of 118 lymph nodes was 3.3±1.2 and 4.2±1.7, respectively. The mean RI was 26.4±24.5%. Higher FDG uptake was observed in patients with calcified nodules and bilateral FDG uptake and in lymph nodes with calcification or short-axis diameter larger than 10 mm.

To get insight into the pathogenesis of this poorly understood process, we studied the function of SAMD9, a protein of unknown function, recently shown to be deficient in a hereditary form of dystrophic calcification in the skin, known as normophosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (NFTC). Consistent with the fact that in NFTC severe inflammatory manifestations always precede cutaneous calcinosis, we found out that SAMD9 is tightly regulated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). In addition, the SAMD9 promoter was also found to respond strongly to IFN-γ in a luciferase reporter assay. Of interest, we identified a critical 30-bp fragment upstream to the SAMD9 transcription initiation site responsible for driving most of the gene expression. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that SAMD9 function involves interaction with additional protein(s). Using the Ras recruitment system assay and confirmatory immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that SAMD9 interacts with RGL2. To study the biological importance of this interaction, we assessed the effect of RNA interference-mediated downregulation of this pair of proteins in various cell lines. We found out that downregulation of any of the two protein partners caused increased expression of EGR1, a transcription factor with a known role in the regulation of tissue calcification, inflammation, and cell migration. Supporting the physiological relevance of these data, EGR1 levels were also upregulated in a fibroblast cell line derived from an NFTC patient. In conclusion, our data indicate that SAMD9, an IFN-γ-responsive protein, interacts with RGL2 to diminish the expression of EGR1, a protein of direct relevance to the pathogenesis of ectopic calcification and inflammation.",2011 Mar
770,"Yang F,Zeng J,Zhang W,Sun X,Ling J",Evaluation of the interaction between calcifying nanoparticles and human dental pulp cells: a preliminary investigation.,"Calcifying nanoparticles (CNPs, previously called nanobacteria) are self-propagating, cultivable macromolecular complexes. Their extraordinary characteristic is that they can aggregate carbonate apatite on their envelope from soluble calcium and phosphorus at physiologic concentrations and display cytotoxic effects on murine and human fibroblast cell lines. The question arises whether CNPs contribute to the degeneration of pulp tissue and thus result in clinically significant human dental pulp stones as nidies. This study evaluates CNPs’ effects upon human dental pulp cells (HDPCs, the host cells in pulp tissue). We observed the ultrastructural variation of HDPCs attacked by CNPs. The spatial relationship of HDPCs and CNPs after coculture was also identified by immunofluroscence staining. Furthermore, it was verified by MTT viability assay that CNPs isolated from dental pulp stones exerted cytotoxic effect on HDPCs. Therefore, it could be concluded that the existence of CNPs might interfere with the normal physiologic function of the cells, and that might lead to dental pulp calcification. Elucidation of the cytotoxic characteristics of CNPs may offer a new perspective for understanding the etiology of human dental pulp stones.",2011 2011

The aim of the present study was to examine whether increased serum Hsp70 levels are related to the extent of arterial calcification and standard laboratory parameters of patients with peripheral artery disease, as well as to markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein), atherosclerosis (homocysteine), and calcification (fetuin-a). One hundred eighty chronic atherosclerotic patients with significant carotid stenosis and/or lower extremity vascular disease were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Systemic atherosclerosis and calcification was assessed by ultrasound (carotid intima–media thickness (IMT), presence of calcification at the abdominal aorta, carotid and femoral bifurcations, and aortic and mitral cardiac valves). Standard serum markers of inflammation, diabetes, renal function, ankle-brachial indexes, and traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis were noted. Serum Hsp70 levels were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Standard laboratory parameters (clinical chemistry), C-reactive protein (CRP), and homocysteine levels were determined by an autoanalyzer using the manufacturer’s kits. Fetuin-a levels were measured by radial immunodiffusion. Patients’ median age was 64 (57–71) years, 69% were men, and 34.5% had diabetes. Serum heat shock protein 70 levels were significantly higher in patients with more severe arterial calcification (p < 0.02) and showed significant positive correlations with serum bilirubin (r = 0.23, p = 0.002) and homocysteine levels (r = 0.18, p = 0.02). Serum Hsp70 did not correlate with body mass index, IMT, CRP, or fetuin-a levels in this cohort. Logistic regression analysis confirmed the association between sHsp70 and calcification score (OR, 2.189; CI, 1.156–4.144, p = 0.016) and this correlation remained significant (OR, 2.264; CI, 1.021–5.020, p = 0.044) after the adjustment for age, sex, eGFR, smoking, CRP, and homocysteine levels. Our data show that serum Hsp70 levels correlate with the severity of atherosclerosis in patients with carotid artery disease and chronic lower limb ischemia. These data support a putative role for plasma Hsp70 in the development of arterial calcification. Nevertheless, further studies are required to investigate the usefulness of circulating Hsp70 level as a marker of atherosclerotic calcification.",2011 May

Cases of known prostate cancer were excluded. The maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax), site (central or peripheral) and pattern (discrete or ill-defined) of FDG uptake, calcification (present or absent) and prostate volume (<30 or ≥30 cc) were recorded. The PET/CT findings were correlated with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, imaging studies, clinical follow-up and biopsy. Of a total of 5119 cases, 63 (1.2%) demonstrated focal FDG uptake in prostate. Eight cases were lost to follow-up. Among the 55 cases with follow-up, malignancy was confirmed by biopsy in 3 (5.4%). The three malignant cases had SUVmax values of 3.3, 3.6 and 2.3, and all were noted in the peripheral portion of prostate; two of these cases had a discrete FDG uptake pattern, none had calcification corresponding to the FDG uptake area and one had a prostatic volume greater than 30 cc. The mean SUVmax of 52 benign cases was 3.2 ± 1.7 and focal FDG uptake was noted in the peripheral portion in 34 (65%), 20 (38%) cases showed a discrete FDG uptake pattern, 35 (67%) were accompanied by calcification and 32 (62%) had a prostatic volume greater than 30 cc.

However, there was limited study to evaluate the effect of different fractionation schemes on soft tissue and the optimal HDR scheme. Aims: We aimed to assess the histopathologic changes on soft tissue after different HDR brachytherapy doses. Methods: The subjects were divided into three groups. Each group included 10 limbs. Group A had only an applicator without radiation, group B received a total of 24 Gy at 6 Gy per fraction, twice a day, and group C received a total of 13.5 Gy in a single fraction. The histopathologic findings were grouped into soft tissue pathology-1 (edema, inflammation, endothelial proliferation, necrosis) and soft tissue pathology-2 (atrophy, calcification, vascular hyalinization, fibrosis) (STP-1–2). Results: The highest mean grade values of STP-1 and STP-2 were observed in group C (0.95 and 1.45) in comparison to group A (0.45 and 0.85) and group B (0.65 and 0.9). The difference in STP-1 was found significant only between groups A and C and the difference in STP-2 was found both between groups A and C and groups B and C. Conclusion: In our experimental study it was shown that the fractionated interstitial HDR had both lower rate and severity of toxicity in comparison to a single high dose fraction. Before using a single fractionated regimen in the clinic, the increased morbidity related to the irreversible early toxicities or progressive late toxicities should be kept in mind.",2010 Nov

Results: Randomized trials and meta-analyses demonstrated that single-fraction radiotherapy with 1 × 8 Gy is as effective for pain relief as multi-fraction regimens such as 5 × 4 Gy or 10 × 3 Gy. Re-irradiation for recurrent pain is required more often after single-fraction radiotherapy. Re-irradiation with another single fraction is safe and effective. Multi-fraction long-course radiotherapy such as 10 × 3 Gy leads to better re-calcification and better local control of metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC). Because both re-calcification and MSCC recurrences occur only several months after radiotherapy, long-course radiotherapy is particularly appropriate for patients with a favorable survival prognosis. Conclusions: For uncomplicated painful bone metastases, single-fraction radiotherapy with 1 × 8 Gy may be considered the standard regimen. If re-calcification is a major goal, longer-course radiotherapy (i.e. 10 × 3 Gy) should be used. For MSCC, 10 × 3 Gy is preferable for patients with a favorable survival prognosis.",2010 Oct
775,"O’Neill WC,Lomashvili KA",Recent progress in the treatment of vascular calcification.,"Vascular calcification is common in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and is associated with poorer outcomes. Although the pathophysiology is not completely understood, it is clear that it is a multifactorial process involving altered mineral metabolism, as well as changes in systemic and local factors that can promote or inhibit vascular calcification, and all of these are potential therapeutic targets. Current therapy is closely linked to strategies for preventing disordered bone and mineral metabolism in advanced kidney disease and involves lowering the circulating levels of both phosphate and calcium. The efficacy of compounds that specifically target calcification, such as bisphosphonates and thiosulfate, has been shown in animals but only in small numbers of humans, and safety remains an issue. Additional therapies, such as pyrophosphate, vitamin K, and lowering of pH, are supported by animal studies, but are yet to be investigated clinically. As the mineral composition of vascular calcifications is the same as in bone, potential effects on bone must be addressed with any therapy for vascular calcification.",2010 Dec

We hypothesized that DNA sequence variation in genes regulating vitamin D metabolism and signaling pathways might influence variation in coronary artery calcification (CAC). Methods and Results: We genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GC, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, and VDR and tested their association with CAC quantity, as measured by electron beam computed tomography. Initial association studies were carried out in a discovery sample comprised of 697 Amish subjects and SNPs nominally associated with CAC quantity (4 SNPs in CYP24A1, P = 0.008-0.00003) were then tested for association with CAC quantity in two independent cohorts of subjects of European Caucasian ancestry (Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) Study (n = 916) and The Penn Coronary Artery Calcification (PennCAC) sample (n = 2,061)). One of the four SNPs, rs2762939, was associated with CAC quantity in both GENOA (P = 0.007) and PennCAC (P = 0.01). In all three populations the rs2762939 C allele was associated with lower CAC quantity. Meta-analysis for the association of this SNP with CAC quantity across all three studies yielded a P value of 2.9 × 10-6. Conclusion: A common SNP in the CYP24A1 gene was associated with CAC quantity in three independent populations. This result suggests a role for vitamin D metabolism in the development of CAC quantity.",2010 Dec
777,"Baker R,Rogers KD,Shepherd N,Stone N",New relationships between breast microcalcifications and cancer.,"Background:: Breast microcalcifications are key diagnostically significant radiological features for localisation of malignancy. This study explores the hypothesis that breast calcification composition is directly related to the local tissue pathological state. Methods:: A total of 236 human breast calcifications from 110 patients were analysed by mid-Fouries transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy from three different pathology types (112 invasive carcinoma (IC), 64 in-situ carcinomas and 60 benign). The biochemical composition and the incorporation of carbonate into the hydroxyapatite lattice of the microcalcifications were studied by infrared microspectroscopy. This allowed the spectrally identified composition to be directly correlated with the histopathology grading of the surrounding tissue. Results:: The carbonate content of breast microcalcifications was shown to significantly decrease when progressing from benign to malignant disease. In this study, we report significant correlations (P<0.001) between microcalcification chemical composition (carbonate content and protein matrix : mineral ratios) and distinct pathology grades (benign, in-situ carcinoma and ICs). Furthermore, a significant correlation (P<0.001) was observed between carbonate concentrations and carcinoma in-situ sub-grades. Using the two measures of pathology-specific calcification composition (carbonate content and protein matrix : mineral ratios) as the inputs to a two-metric discriminant model sensitivities of 79, 84 and 90% and specificities of 98, 82 and 96% were achieved for benign, ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive malignancies, respectively. Conclusions:: We present the first demonstration of a direct link between the chemical nature of microcalcifications and the grade of the pathological breast disease. This suggests that microcalcifications have a significant association with cancer progression, and could be used for future objective analytical classification of breast pathology. A simple two-metric model has been demonstrated, more complex spectral analysis may yeild greater discrimination performance. Furthermore there appears to be a sequential progression of calcification composition.",2010 Sep 28
778,"Flegg KM,Flaherty JJ,Bicknell AM,Jain S",Surgical outcomes of borderline breast lesions detected by needle biopsy in a breast screening program.,"Background: The Australian Capital Territory and South East New South Wales branch of BreastScreen Australia (BreastScreen ACT&SENSW) performs over 20,000 screening mammograms annually. This study describes the outcome of surgical biopsies of the breast performed as a result of a borderline lesion being identified after screening mammography and subsequent workup.A secondary aim was to identify any parameters, such as a family history of breast cancer, or radiological findings that may indicate which borderline lesions are likely to be upgraded to malignancy after surgery. Methods: From a period of just over eight years, all patients of BreastScreen ACT&SENSW who were diagnosed with a borderline breast lesion were identified. These women had undergone needle biopsy in Breastscreen ACT&SENSW and either atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), flat epithelial atypia (FEA), atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), radial scar/complex sclerosing lesion, papillary lesion, mucocoele-like lesion (MLL) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) was found. Final outcomes for each type of borderline lesion after referral for surgical biopsy were recorded and analysed. Results of the surgical biopsy were compared to the type of needle biopsy and its result, radiological findings and family history status. Results: Of the 94 surgical biopsies performed due to the presence of a borderline breast lesion, 20% showed benign pathology, 55% remained as borderline lesions, 17% showed non-invasive malignancy and 7% showed invasive malignancy. VALCS biopsy was the most common needle biopsy method used to identify the lesions in this study (76%). Malignant outcomes resulted from 24% of the surgical biopsies, with the most common malignant lesion being non-comedo ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The most common borderline lesion for which women underwent surgical biopsy was ADH (38%). Of these women, 22% were confirmed as ADH on surgical biopsy and 47% with a malignancy. Conclusions: Further research is required to determine whether characteristics of the mammographic lesion (particularly calcification patterns), the area targeted for biopsy and number of core samples retrieved, can indicate a closer correlation with eventual pathology. This study identified no findings in the diagnostic assessment that could exclude women with borderline lesions from surgical biopsy.",2010
779,"Bielak LF,Whaley DH,Sheedy PF,Peyser PA",Breast Arterial Calcification Is Associated with Reproductive Factors in Asymptomatic Postmenopausal Women.,"Objective: The etiology of breast arterial calcification (BAC) is not well understood. We examined reproductive history and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor associations with the presence of detectable BAC in asymptomatic postmenopausal women. Methods: Reproductive history and CVD risk factors were obtained in 240 asymptomatic postmenopausal women from a community-based research study who had a screening mammogram within 2 years of their participation in the study. The mammograms were reviewed for the presence of detectable BAC. Age-adjusted logistic regression models were fit to assess the association between each risk factor and the presence of BAC. Multiple variable logistic regression models were used to identify the most parsimonious model for the presence of BAC. Results: The prevalence of BAC increased with increased age (p < 0.0001). The most parsimonious logistic regression model for BAC presence included age at time of examination, increased parity (p = 0.01), earlier age at first birth (p = 0.002), weight, and an age-by-weight interaction term (p = 0.004). Older women with a smaller body size had a higher probability of having BAC than women of the same age with a larger body size. Conclusions: The presence or absence of BAC at mammography may provide an assessment of a postmenopausal woman's lifetime estrogen exposure and indicate women who could be at risk for hormonally related conditions.",2010 Sep

The macroscopic fat was not associated with calcification on the pre-operative CT scan. To our knowledge, there are no reported cases of RCC that contain osseous metaplasia without evidence of macroscopic calcification on CT. The finding is significant because standard imaging practice is to classify a renal mass containing intratumoral macroscopic fat that is not associated with calcification, ossification or invasion of perirenal or hilar fat as an angiomyolipoma.",2010 Aug

The purpose of this study was to determine whether histologic findings in negative SLNs after preoperative chemotherapy are helpful in assessing the accuracy of SLN biopsy in patients with confirmed lymph node-positive disease before treatment. METHODS: Eighty-six patients with confirmed lymph node-positive disease at presentation underwent successful SLN biopsy and axillary dissection after preoperative chemotherapy at a single institution between 1994 and 2007. Available hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from patients with negative SLNs were reviewed, and associations between histologic findings in the negative SLNs and SLN status (true negative vs false negative) were evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-seven (55%) patients had at least 1 positive SLN, and 39 (45%) patients had negative SLNs. The false-negative rate was 22%, and the negative predictive value was 67%. The negative SLNs from 17 of 34 patients with available slides had focal areas of fibrosis, some with associated foamy parenchymal histiocytes, fat necrosis, or calcification. These histologic findings occurred in 15 (65%) of 23 patients with true-negative SLNs and in only 2 (18%) of 11 patients with false-negative SLNs (P =.03, Fisher exact test, 2-tailed). The lack of these histologic changes had a sensitivity and specificity for identifying a false-negative SLN of 82% and 65%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of treatment effect in SLNs after chemotherapy in patients with lymph node-positive disease at initial presentation has good sensitivity but low specificity for identifying a false-negative SLN.",2010 Jun 15
782,"Khan AN,Al-Jahdali HH,Allen CM,Irion KL,Al Ghanem S,Koteyar SS",The calcified lung nodule: What does it mean?,"The aim of this review is to present a pictorial essay emphasizing the various patterns of calcification in pulmonary nodules (PN) to aid diagnosis and to discuss the differential diagnosis and the pathogenesis where it is known. The imaging evaluation of PN is based on clinical history, size, distribution and the gross appearance of the nodule as well as feasibility of obtaining a tissue diagnosis. Imaging is instrumental in the management of PN and one should strive not only to identify small malignant tumors with high survival rates but to spare patients with benign PN from undergoing unnecessary surgery. The review emphasizes how to achieve these goals. One of the most reliable imaging features of a benign lesion is a benign pattern of calcification and periodic follow-up with computed tomography showing no growth for 2 years. Calcification in PN is generally considered as a pointer toward a possible benign disease. However, as we show here, calcification in PN as a criterion to determine benign nature is fallacious and can be misleading. The differential considerations of a calcified lesion include calcified granuloma, hamartoma, carcinoid, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma and lung metastases or a primary bronchogenic carcinoma among others. We describe and illustrate different patterns of calcification as seen in PN on imaging.",2010 Apr-Jun
783,"Hayashi Y,Lagarde F,Tsuda N,Funamoto S,Preston DL,Koyama K,Mabuchi K,Ron E,Kodama K,Tokuoka S",Papillary Microcarcinoma of the Thyroid among Atomic Bomb Survivors: Tumor Characteristics and Radiation Risk.,"Background: Radiation exposure is an established cause of clinical thyroid cancer, but little is known about radiation effects on papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) of the thyroid, a relatively common subclinical thyroid malignancy. Because the incidence of these small thyroid cancers has been increasing, it is important to better understand them and their relationship to radiation. Methods: PMCs were identified in a subset of 7659 members of the Life Span Study of atomic-bomb survivors who had archived autopsy or surgical materials. We conducted a pathology review of these specimens and evaluated the histological features of the tumors and the association between PMCs and thyroid radiation dose. Results: From 1958 to1995, 458 PMCs were detected among 313 study subjects. The majority of cancers exhibited pathologic features of papillary thyroid cancers. Overall, 81% of the PMCs were of the sclerosing variant and 91% were nonencapsulated, psammoma bodies occurred in 13% and calcification was observed in 23%. Over 95% had papillary or papillary-follicular architecture and most displayed nuclear overlap, clear nuclei, and nuclear grooves. Several of these features increased with increasing tumor size, but no association was found with radiation dose. A significant radiation-dose response was found for the prevalence of PMCs (estimated excess odds ratio/Gy=0.57; 95% CI: 0.01-1.55), with the excess risk observed primarily among females. Conclusion: Low-to-moderate doses of ionizing radiation appears to increase the risk of thyroid PMCs, even when exposure occurs during adulthood.",2010 Apr 1
784,"Nakayama R,Abe H,Shiraishi J,Doi K",Evaluation of Objective Similarity Measures for Selecting Similar Images of Mammographic Lesions.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate four objective similarity measures as an image retrieval tool for selecting lesions similar to unknown lesions on mammograms. Measures A and B were based on the Euclidean distance in feature space and the psychophysical similarity measure, respectively. Measure C was the sequential combination of B and A, whereas measure D was the sequential combination of A and B. In this study, we selected 100 lesions each for masses and clustered microcalcifications randomly from our database, and we selected five pairs of lesions from 4,950 pairs based on all combinations of the 100 lesions by use of each measure. In two observer studies for 20 mass pairs and 20 calcification pairs, six radiologists compared all combinations of 20 pairs by using a two-alternative forced-choice method to determine the subjective similarity ranking score which was obtained from the frequency with which a pair was considered as more similar than the other 19 pairs. In both mass and calcification pairs, pairs selected by use of measure D had the highest mean value of the average subjective similarity ranking scores. The difference between measures D and A (P = 0.008 and 0.024), as well as that between measures D and B (P = 0.018 and 0.028) were statistically significant for masses and microcalcifications, respectively. The sequential combination of the objective similarity measure based on the Euclidean distance and the psychophysical similarity measure would be useful in the selection of images similar to those of unknown lesions.",2011 Feb
785,"Dusso A,Arcidiacono MV,Yang J,Tokumoto M",VITAMIN D INHIBITION OF TACE AND PREVENTION OF RENAL OSTEODYSTROPHY AND CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY.,"In the course of kidney disease, the progressive loss of renal capacity to maintain normal serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) is a main contributor to parathyroid hyperplasia and high serum PTH. High PTH causes mineral and skeletal abnormalities predisposing to ectopic calcifications and increased mortality. Intriguingly, replacement therapy with 1,25(OH)2D or its less calcemic analogs was recently shown to improve survival in kidney disease patients through renal and cardiovascular protective actions that are independent of PTH suppression. This work presents preliminary evidence that 1,25(OH)2D inhibition of TACE (Tumor necrosis factor Alpha Converting Enzyme) is a potential common mechanism underlying the efficacy of therapy with 1,25(OH)2D or its analogs to improve outcomes in chronic kidney disease. 1,25(OH)2D prevents/moderates not only the onset and progression of parathyroid TACE/TGFα-driven secondary hyperparathyroidism, but, more significantly, renal TACE/TGFα-driven fibrotic and inflammatory lesions to the renal parenchyma, and TACE/TNFα-driven systemic inflammation, which is known to aggravate renal and cardiovascular lesions and enhance the risk of vascular calcification and cardiovascular mortality.",2010 Jul

Vitamin D also elicits numerous intracrine actions when circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the metabolite reflecting vitamin D status, is converted to 1,25D locally by extrarenal CYP27B1, and binds VDR to promote immunoregulation, antimicrobial defense, xenobiotic detoxification, anti-inflammatory/anticancer actions and cardiovascular benefits. VDR also affects Wnt signaling through direct interaction with β-catenin, ligand-dependently blunting β-catenin mediated transcription in colon cancer cells to attenuate growth, while potentiating β-catenin signaling via VDR ligand-independent mechanisms in osteoblasts and keratinocytes to function osteogenically and as a pro-hair cycling receptor, respectively. Finally, VDR also drives the mammalian hair cycle in conjunction with the hairless corepressor by repressing SOSTDC1, S100A8/S100A9, and PTHrP. Hair provides a shield against UV-induced skin damage and cancer in terrestrial mammals, illuminating another function of VDR that facilitates healthful aging.",2010 Jul
787,"Moyle P,Sonoda L,Britton P,Sinnatamby R",Incidental breast lesions detected on CT: what is their significance?,"An increasing number of breast lesions are being detected incidentally on CT. The aim of this study was to investigate the rate of referrals to the breast unit for assessment of lesions identified on CT and the resulting yield of previously undiagnosed breast malignancies from this pathway. A retrospective review was undertaken of CT examinations conducted over a period of 14 years. All patients (with no previous history of breast cancer) whose report contained the keyword “breast” and who were referred to a specialist breast unit for assessment were reviewed. CT lesion morphology and enhancement pattern were identified and compared with the final diagnostic outcome. 70 patients were identified by retrospective analysis, yielding 78 incidental breast lesions, of which 22 (28.2%) were malignant (category B5). This gave a positive predictive value (PPV) for malignancy of 28.2%. The best morphological predictor of malignancy was spiculation (PPV, 76%) and irregularity (PPV, 58%), whereas calcification patterns (PPV, 36%) were diagnostically unhelpful. Malignant lesions were likely to be larger (mean, 28.5 mm) than benign lesions (mean, 20.2 mm; p<0.05). In conclusion, 30% of incidental breast lesions in this large series of patients proved to be unsuspected breast cancers, particularly irregular spiculated masses. Referral for formal triple assessment of CT-diagnosed breast lesions is worthwhile, and careful examination of the breast should be a routine part of CT examinations.",2010 Mar
788,"Sabour S,Grobbee D,Rutten A,Prokop M,Bartelink ML,van der Schouw Y,Bots M",Electrocardiogram Abnormalities and Coronary Calcification in Postmenopausal Women.,"Background:: An electrocardiogram (ECG) can provide information on subclinical myocardial damage. The presence, and more importantly, the quantity of coronary artery calcification (CAC), relates well with the overall severity of the atherosclerotic process. A strong relation has been demonstrated between coronary calcium burden and the incidence of myocardial infarction, a relation independent of age. The aim of this study was to assess the relation of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and ECG abnormalities with CAC. Methods:: The study population comprised 566 postmenopausal women selected from a population-based cohort study. Information on LVH and repolarization abnormalities (T-axis and QRS-T angle) was obtained using electrocardiography. Modular ECG Analysis System (MEANS) was used to assess ECG abnormalities. The women underwent a multi detector-row computed tomography (MDCT) scan (Philips Mx 8000 IDT 16) to assess CAC. The Agatston score was used to quantify CAC; scores greater than zero were considered as the presence of coronary calcium. Logistic regression was used to assess the relation of ECG abnormality with coronary calcification. Results:: LVH was found in 2.7% (n = 15) of the women. The prevalence of T-axis abnormality was 6% (n = 34), whereas 8.5% (n = 48) had a QRS-T angle abnormality. CAC was found in 62% of the women. Compared to women with a normal T-axis, women with borderline or abnormal T-axes were 3.8 fold more likely to have CAC (95% CI: 1.4–10.2). Similarly, compared to women with a normal QRS-T angle, in women with borderline or abnormal QRS-T angle, CAC was 2.0 fold more likely to be present (95% CI: 1.0–4.1). Conclusion:: Among women with ECG abnormalities reflecting subclinical ischemia, CAC is commonly found and may in part explain the increased coronary heart disease risk associated with these ECG abnormalities.",2010 Winter 2010
789,"Antonio ALM,Crespi CM",Predictors of interobserver agreement in breast imaging using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).,"Objective: The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) was introduced in 1993 to standardize the interpretation of mammograms. Though many studies have assessed the validity of the system, fewer have examined its reliability. Our objective was to identify predictors of reliability as measured by the kappa statistic. Methods: We identified studies conducted between 1993 and 2009 which reported kappa values for interpreting mammograms using any edition of BI-RADS. Bivariate and multivariate multilevel analyses were used to examine associations between potential predictors and kappa values. Results: We identified ten eligible studies, which yielded 88 kappa values for the analysis. Potential predictors of kappa included: whether or not the study included negative cases, whether single-view or two-view mammograms were used, whether or not mammograms were digital vs. screen-film, whether or not the 4th edition of BI-RADS was utilized, the BI-RADS category being evaluated, whether or not readers were trained, whether or not there was an overlap in readers’ professional activities, the number of cases in the study and the country in which the study was conducted. Our best multivariate model identified training, use of two-view mammograms and BI-RADS categories (masses, calcifications and final assessments) as predictors of kappa. Conclusion: Training, use of two-view mammograms and focusing on mass description may be useful in increasing reliability in mammogram interpretation. Calcification and final assessment descriptors are areas for potential improvement. These findings are important for implementing policies in BI-RADS use before introducing the system in different settings and improving current implementations.",2010 Apr

Methods: Mammograms from 142 women who underwent biopsy were evaluated. 3 breast radiologists (2 with >10 years experience and 1 with 1 year experience) and 1 general radiologist retrospectively reviewed mammograms twice within an 8-week interval. Inter- and intra-observer variabilities were assessed with Cohen's kappa statistic, and the positive predictive value for final assessments was calculated. Results: The intra-observer variability for mass and calcification assessments was moderate to almost perfect (kappa values: 0.41–1) for breast imagers and was fair to substantial for the general radiologist (kappa values: 0.21–0.8). Inter-observer agreement between the breast imagers was higher than between the breast and general radiologists. There was no apparent difference in agreement between observers for malignant and benign subgroups. Conclusions: The differences in intra- and inter-observer agreement between the breast imagers and the general radiologist affirm the utility of the BI-RADS lexicon. The histopathologic results of the lesions do not affect the agreement. BI-RADS is a simple and adequate tool for assessing mammograms, even after only 1 year of training.",2010 Mar
791,"Ranger NT,Lo JY,Samei E",A technique optimization protocol and the potential for dose reduction in digital mammography.,"Digital mammography requires revisiting techniques that have been optimized for prior screen∕film mammography systems. The objective of the study was to determine optimized radiographic technique for a digital mammography system and demonstrate the potential for dose reduction in comparison to the clinically established techniques based on screen- film. An objective figure of merit (FOM) was employed to evaluate a direct-conversion amorphous selenium (a-Se) FFDM system (Siemens Mammomat NovationDR, Siemens AG Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) and was derived from the quotient of the squared signal-difference-to-noise ratio to mean glandular dose, for various combinations of technique factors and breast phantom configurations including kilovoltage settings (23–35 kVp), target∕filter combinations (Mo–Mo and W–Rh), breast-equivalent plastic in various thicknesses (2–8 cm) and densities (100% adipose, 50% adipose∕50% glandular, and 100% glandular), and simulated mass and calcification lesions. When using a W–Rh spectrum, the optimized FOM results for the simulated mass and calcification lesions showed highly consistent trends with kVp for each combination of breast density and thickness. The optimized kVp ranged from 26 kVp for 2 cm 100% adipose breasts to 30 kVp for 8 cm 100% glandular breasts. The use of the optimized W–Rh technique compared to standard Mo–Mo techniques provided dose savings ranging from 9% for 2 cm thick, 100% adipose breasts, to 63% for 6 cm thick, 100% glandular breasts, and for breasts with a 50% adipose∕50% glandular composition, from 12% for 2 cm thick breasts up to 57% for 8 cm thick breasts.",2010 Mar

It is characterized by widespread vascular calcification, endothelial fibrosis and end-organ ischemia. The mortality rate is high with infection and sepsis being the most common causes of death. Common therapies include restoration of calcium and phosphorous homeostasis, wound care and pain control. Although soft tissue calcification is a known complication in children with advanced renal disease, the incidence of CUA in pediatrics remains unknown. Additionally, current literature regarding its management in pediatric patients is lacking. We report the case of a 17-year-old African–American male patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to Wegener’s granulomatosis who developed CUA after 3 years on peritoneal dialysis. Treatment with sodium thiosulfate (STS) and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy alone was ineffective, forcing the patient to undergo bilateral below the-knee-amputation (BKA) 5 months after presentation. It was not until peritoneal dialysis had been changed to daily hemodialysis, while continuing STS and HBO therapy, that the patient demonstrated complete resolution of CUA on repeat bone scan. Based on these findings, and the extremely high mortality rate associated with this disease, CUA management requires early and aggressive intervention with multi-faceted therapy, including prompt conversion from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis, STS infusions and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.",2010

This paper investigated the image reconstruction with a standard biopsy training breast phantom using a novel multi-beam X-ray sources breast tomosynthesis system. Carbon nanotube technology based X-ray tubes were lined up along a parallel-imaging geometry to decrease the motion blur. Five representative reconstruction algorithms, including back projection (BP), filtered back projection (FBP), matrix inversion tomosynthesis (MITS), maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) and simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), were investigated to evaluate the image reconstruction of the tomosynthesis system. Reconstructed images of the masses and micro-calcification clusters embedded in the phantom were studied. The evaluated multi-beam X-ray breast tomosynthesis system is able to generate three-dimensional information of the breast phantom with clearly-identified regions of the masses and calcifications.

These are aggressive tumors and are commonly associated with conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinomas, but cases associated with chromophobe renal cell carcinomas are sparse. Cytological features of such lesions have rarely been reported. Here, we report a unique case of a 48-year-old male patient who presented with right flank lump and pain. A fine needle aspiration was performed from the lesion under ultrasound guidance and a cytological diagnosis of pleomorphic sarcoma was made. A right-sided radical nephrectomy was carried out and subsequent histopathology revealed a sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma with wide areas of necrosis coexisting with chromophobe renal cell carcinoma with calcification. Differentiation of pleomorphic sarcoma from a sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma is, thus, challenging from cytopathology smears and the differential diagnoses should always be borne in mind while giving a cytopathological opinion.",2010 Jan

A Harris Hip Score (HHS) was preoperatively calculated for every patient.Slab specimens from the femoral head of bone and cartilage and an additional square centimeter of articular cartilage from the main chondral defect were obtained from each patient for analysis of mineralization by digital contact radiography (DCR). Histological grading was also performed. In a subset of 20 patients, minerals were characterized with an electron microscope (FE-SEM). Results: Calcifications were seen in all OA cartilage and slab specimens using DCR, while preoperative X-rays revealed calcification in only 17.5%. None of the control cartilage specimens showed mineralization. There was a highly significant inverse correlation between articular cartilage calcification and preoperative HHS. Histological OA grade correlated positively with the amount of matrix calcification. FE-SEM analysis revealed basic calcium phosphate (BCP) as the predominant mineral; CPPD crystals were found in only two patients. Conclusions: Articular cartilage calcification is a common event in osteoarthritis of the hip. The amount of calcification correlates with clinical symptoms and histological OA grade.",2009

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of chondrocyte maturation and calcification by Sox9 remain unknown. In this study, we attempted to clarify roles of Sox9 in the late stages of chondrocyte differentiation. We found that overexpression of Sox9 alone or Sox9 together with Sox5 and Sox6 (Sox5/6/9) inhibited the maturation and calcification of murine primary chondrocytes and up-regulated parathyroid hormone–related protein (PTHrP) expression in primary chondrocytes and the mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2. Sox5/6/9 stimulated the early stages of chondrocyte proliferation and development. In contrast, Sox5/6/9 inhibited maturation and calcification of chondrocytes in organ culture. The inhibitory effects of Sox5/6/9 were rescued by treating with anti-PTHrP antibody. Moreover, Sox5/6/9 bound to the promoter region of the PTHrP gene and up-regulated PTHrP gene promoter activity. Interestingly, we also found that the Sox9 family members functionally collaborated with Ihh/Gli2 signaling to regulate PTHrP expression and chondrocyte differentiation. Our results provide novel evidence that Sox9 family members mediate endochondral ossification by up-regulating PTHrP expression in association with Ihh/Gli2 signaling.",2009 Nov 1
797,"Liu F,Misra P,Lunsford EP,Vannah JT,Liu Y,Lenkinski RE,Frangioni JV",A Dose- and Time-Controllable Syngeneic Animal Model of Breast Cancer Microcalcification.,"Introduction: The development of novel diagnostic agents for the detection of breast cancer microcalcifications requires a reliable animal model. Based on previous work from our group, we hypothesized that a single systemic injection of recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rBMP-2) could be used to create such a model. Methods: The cDNA encoding mature human BMP-2 was expressed in BL21(DE3) bacteria, purified to homogeneity, and re-folded as a dimer. Bioactivity was confirmed using a C2C12 alkaline phosphatase assay. rBMP-2 was radiolabeled with 99mTc and its biodistribution and clearance were quantified after both intravenous (IV) and intraperitoneal (IP) injection. Fischer 344 rats bearing syngeneic R3230 breast tumors received a single intraperitoneal injection of rBMP-2 at a specified dose. Tumor microcalcification was quantified over time using micro single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and micro computed tomography (CT). Results: rBMP-2 could be expressed in E. coli at high levels, isolated at >95% purity, and refolded to a bioactive dimer. Beta-phase half-life was 30.5 min after IV administration and 47.6 min after IP administration. Renal excretion was the primary mode of clearance. A single IP injection of ≥ 50 μg rBMP-2 when tumors were not yet palpable resulted in dose-dependent microcalcification in 8 of 8 R3230 tumors. No calcification was found in control tumors, or in normal tissues and organs of animals injected with rBMP-2. Tumor calcification increased progressively between weeks 2 to 4 post-rBMP-2 injection. Conclusions: A single IP injection of rBMP-2 in rats bearing a syngeneic breast cancer will produce dose-dependent and time-dependent microcalcifications. This animal model lays the foundation for the development of novel diagnostic radiotracers for breast cancer.",2010 Jul
798,"Mertsch S,Schurgers LJ,Weber K,Paulus W,Senner V",Matrix gla protein (MGP): an overexpressed and migration-promoting mesenchymal component in glioblastoma.,"Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that a molecular subtype of glioblastoma is characterized by overexpression of extracellular matrix (ECM)/mesenchymal components and shorter survival. Specifically, gene expression profiling studies revealed that matrix gla protein (MGP), whose function has traditionally been linked to inhibition of calcification of arteries and cartilage, is overexpressed in glioblastomas and associated with worse outcome. Methods: In order to analyze the role of MGP in glioblastomas, we performed expression, migration and proliferation studies. Results: Real-time PCR and ELISA assays confirmed overexpression of MGP in glioblastoma biopsy specimens and cell lines at mRNA and protein levels as compared to normal brain tissue. Immunohistochemistry verified positivity of glial tumor cells for MGP. RNAi-mediated knockdown of MGP in three glioma cell lines (U343MG, U373MG, H4) led to marked reduction of migration, as demonstrated by wound healing and transwell assays, while no effect on proliferation was seen. Conclusion: Our data suggest that upregulation of MGP (and possibly other ECM-related components as well) results in unfavorable prognosis via increased migration.",2009

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a case-control study consisting of 40 women with coronary artery disease in the case group and 40 women without any history of coronary artery disease in the control group who were matched according to age. The study was approved by the Institution’s Research Ethics Committee (consent statement was obtained). Odds ratios and confidence intervals were calculated using univariate analysis. Interrelationships among other risk factors, such as arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking and diabetes mellitus, were calculated using multivariate analysis. A p <0.05 was considered to be significant for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean ages for the case and control groups were 64.65 years and 63.88 years, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the only variables related to coronary artery disease were Vascular calcification [OR 4.71 (CI 1.36–16.33) p=0.014], family history [OR 5.76 (CI 1.58–21.03) p=0.008] and arterial hypertension [OR 15.92 (CI 3.12–81.14) p=0.001]. Although smoking and diabetes are important variables in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease, these factors did not show statistically significant associations in this sample. CONCLUSION: The presence of vascular calcifications seen via mammography was an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease, as were hypertension and a family history of coronary artery disease.",2009 Aug
800,"Kim KP,Einstein AJ,de Gonzalez AB",Coronary artery calcification screening: estimated radiation dose and cancer risk.,"Background: Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) has been proposed as a tool for routine screening for coronary artery calcification (CAC) in asymptomatic individuals. As proposed, such screening could involve tens of millions of individuals, but detailed estimates of radiation doses and potential risk of radiation-induced cancer are not currently available. We estimated organ-specific radiation doses and associated cancer risks from CAC screening with MDCT, according to age, frequency and scan protocol. Methods: Radiation doses to adult patients were calculated from a range of available protocols using Monte Carlo radiation transport. Radiation risk models, derived using data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors and medically-exposed cohorts, were used to estimate the excess lifetime risk of radiation-induced cancer. Results: Radiation dose from a single CAC CT scan varied more than 10-fold (effective dose range=0.8 to 10.5 mSv) depending on the protocol. In general higher radiation doses were associated with higher x-ray tube current, higher tube potential, and spiral scanning with low pitch, and retrospective gating. The wide dose variation also resulted in wide variation in estimated radiation-induced cancer risk. Assuming screening every five years from age 45-75 for men and from age 55-75 for women, the estimated excess lifetime cancer risk using the median dose of 2.3 mSv (0.8-10.5 mSv) was 42 cases/100,000 for men (range 14-200) and 62 cases/100,000 for women (range 21-300). Conclusions: These radiation risk estimates can be compared to potential benefits from screening, when such estimates are available. Doses and hence risks can be minimized by using optimized protocols.",2009 Jul 13
801,"Armah HB,Parwani AV,Perepletchikov AM",Synchronous primary carcinoid tumor and primary adenocarcinoma arising within mature cystic teratoma of horseshoe kidney: a unique case report and review of the literature.,"Background: Malignant transformation of mature cystic teratoma is a rare complication. While any of the constituent tissues of a teratoma has the potential to undergo malignant transformation, squamous cell carcinoma is the most commonly associated malignancy. Renal carcinoid tumors are rare and frequently associated with horseshoe kidney and renal teratoma. Renal teratoma rarely presents together with carcinoid tumor or adenocarcinoma. To the best of our knowledge, there has never been a report of renal teratoma coexisting with both carcinoid tumor and adenocarcinoma. Methods: Here, we present a unique and first case of synchronous primary carcinoid tumor and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising within mature cystic teratoma of horseshoe kidney in a 50-year-old female. Lumbar spine X-ray, done for her complaint of progressive chronic low back pain, accidentally found a large calcification overlying the lower pole of the right kidney. Further radiologic studies revealed horseshoe kidney and a large multiseptated cystic lesion immediately anterior to the right renal pelvis with central calcification and peripheral enhancement. She underwent right partial nephrectomy. Results: Macroscopically, the encapsulated complex solid and multiloculated cystic tumor with large calcification, focal thickened walls and filled with yellow-tan gelatinous material. Microscopically, the tumor showed coexistent mature cystic teratoma, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and carcinoid tumor. Immunohistochemically, alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A-racemase, calretinin, CD10 and thyroid transcription factor-1 were negative in all the three components of the tumor. The teratomatous cysts lined by ciliated epithelium showed strong staining for cytokeratin 7 and pancytokeratin, and those lined by colonic-like epithelium showed strong staining for CDX2, cytokeratin 20 and pancytokeratin, but both were negative for calretinin. Additionally, the teratomatous cyst wall showed strong staining for smooth muscle actin, and weak staining for carbonic anhydrase IX, CD99, chromogranin and synaptophysin. The adenocarcinoma component was strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 and pancytokeratin, weakly positive for synaptophysin and CD56, and negative for carbonic anhydrase IX, CD99, CDX2, chromogranin, cytokeratin 20 and smooth muscle actin. The carcinoid tumor component was strongly positive for CD56, chromogranin and synaptophysin, weakly positive for pancytokeratin, and negative for carbonic anhydrase IX, CD99, CDX2, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20 and smooth muscle actin. She received no adjuvant therapy and is alive without evidence of disease six months after diagnosis and surgery. Conclusion: This unique and first case herein presented with synchronous primary carcinoid tumor and primary adenocarcinoma arising within mature cystic teratoma of horseshoe kidney emphasizes the need for thorough sectioning and entire submission for histologic evaluation of mature cystic teratomas, in order to avoid missing multiple additional histogenetically distinct neoplasms.",2009

In ten cases of primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma with heterotopic ossification, we detected immunoreactivity against TGF-β1, osteopontin, osteocalcin and Runx2 in the fibroblastic stroma and tumor cells within the area of ossification. Our results suggest that in primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma, heterotopic ossification occurs via intramembranous bone formation. To our knowledge, only 11 other cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with heterotopic ossification have been reported. Here, we present ten cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma showing heterotopic ossification with a description of previously published results and the histogenesis of heterotopic bone formation.",2009 Jun

To classify these tumors, we applied a panel of antibodies (vimentin, desmin, α-SMA, and ED1) and Azan staining for collagen. The MFHs were most consistent with osteoclast-like giant and inflammatory cell types. The first case had positive staining for ED1 and vimentin, and given the osteoclast-like giant cells, calcification sites accompanying peripheral giant cell infiltrates. The latter case, the inflammatory cell type, exhibited a storiform-pleomorphic variant of neoplastic cells, including an ossifying matrix. MFHs are among the most highly aggressive tumors occurring in soft tissue sarcomas in elderly dogs; however, MFHs have been poorly studied from a diagnostic point of view. Herein, we describe the histologic and immunohistologic features of MFHs in detail, thus classifying the subtypes of these tumors.",2009 Jun

Vitamin D might have beneficial effects on vascular health. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25D] ≤ 15 ng/ml) and insufficiency (25D levels between 16 and 30 ng/ml) in a cohort of patients at different CKD stages and the relationships between vitamin D serum levels, vascular calcification and stiffness, and the mortality risk.Design, setting, participants & measurements: One hundred forty CKD patients (85 men, mean age 67 ± 12 yr; CKD stages 2 [8%], 3 [26%], 4 [26%], 5 [7%], and 5D [(33%]) were allocated for a prospective study. Serum levels of 25D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, aortic calcification score, and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were evaluated.Results: There was a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (42%) and insufficiency (34%). Patients with 25D ≤ 16.7 ng/ml (median) had a significantly lower survival rate than patients with 25D >16.7 ng/ml (mean follow-up, 605 ± 217 d; range, 10 to 889; P = 0.05). Multivariate adjustments (included age, gender, diabetes, arterial pressure, CKD stage, phosphate, albumin, hemoglobin, aortic calcification score and PWV) confirmed 25D level as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality.Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were highly prevalent in this CKD cohort. Low 25D levels affected mortality independently of vascular calcification and stiffness, suggesting that 25D may influence survival in CKD patients via additional pathways that need to be further explored.",2009 Jun

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are potential candidate genes that may mediate this relationship. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BMP2 gene, 2 SNPs in BMP4, and 16 SNPs in BMP7 were tested for association with measures of VC using CT (coronary and carotid arteries, abdominal aorta), and BMD was measured using DXA (lumbar spine, hip, and distal radius) and quantitative CT (QCT; thoracic and lumbar spine) in 920 European Americans from 374 Diabetes Heart Study families: 762 with type 2 diabetes. Variance components quantitative trait locus association analysis was computed using SOLAR software, and a bivariate principal component analysis (PCA) assessed for genetic relationships between BMD and VC. Association was observed between several measures of BMD and BMP7 rs17404303 (thoracic spine QCT p = 0.03; lumbar spine QCT p = 0.02; hip DXA p = 0.06, dominant models). In addition, 6 of 16 BMP7 SNPs showed significant and opposing effects on the bivariate PCA for VC and BMD (two-sided exact test, p = 0.0143). Polymorphisms in BMP7 are associated with inverse relationships between bone mineralization and VC in the coronary, carotid, and abdominal aorta in a diabetes-enriched cohort of European Americans.",2009 Oct

Methods: Calcifications, removed from 4 girls with JDM symptoms for 36.9 ± 48.3 months, were stained for SIBLING proteins: osteopontin OPN (full length), bone sialoprotein (BSP), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), dentin phosphoprotein (DPP), matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE); bone markers: osteocalcin (OC), core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfa1), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) for osteoblasts; tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) for osteoclasts, as well as the mineral regulators osteonectin (ON) and matrix Gla protein (MGP). The deposit center, periphery, adjacent connective tissue, and vascular endothelial cells were examined. Results: Alizarin red stained calcified deposits, which did not localize with collagen, like bone, under polarized light. H+E stain revealed a paucity of connective tissue and absence of bone-like structures. The deposits, connective tissue, and vascular endothelial cells were positive for BSP, DPP, DMP1, and ALP; MEPE was not detected. OC, ON and MGP were present in the deposits and vascular endothelial cells; OPN and Cbfa1 were present in deposits and connective tissue. TRAP positive osteoclasts were localized to the calcification periphery. Conclusion: The disorganized JDM calcifications differ in structure, composition and protein content from bone, suggesting that they may not form through an osteogenic pathway. Osteoclasts at the deposit surface represent an attempt to initiate its resolution.",2009 Apr 15
807,"Rennenberg RJMW,Kessels AGH,Schurgers LJ,van Engelshoven JMA,de Leeuw PW,Kroon AA",Vascular calcifications as a marker of increased cardiovascular risk: A meta-analysis.,"Background:: Several imaging techniques may reveal calcification of the arterial wall or cardiac valves. Many studies indicate that the risk for cardiovascular disease is increased when calcification is present. Recent meta-analyses on coronary calcification and cardiovascular risk may be confounded by indication. Therefore, this meta-analysis was performed with extensive subgroup analysis to assess the overall cardiovascular risk of finding calcification in any arterial wall or cardiac valve when using different imaging techniques. Methods and results:: A meta-analysis of prospective studies reporting calcifications and cardiovascular end-points was performed. Thirty articles were selected. The overall odds ratios (95% confidence interval [CI]) for calcifications versus no calcifications in 218,080 subjects after a mean follow-up of 10.1 years amounted to 4.62 (CI 2.24 to 9.53) for all cause mortality, 3.94 (CI 2.39 to 6.50) for cardiovascular mortality, 3.74 (CI 2.56 to 5.45) for coronary events, 2.21 (CI 1.81 to 2.69) for stroke, and 3.41 (CI 2.71 to 4.30) for any cardiovascular event. Heterogeneity was largely explained by length of follow up and sort of imaging technique. Subgroup analysis of patients with end stage renal disease revealed a much higher odds ratio for any event of 6.22 (CI 2.73 to 14.14). Conclusion:: The presence of calcification in any arterial wall is associated with a 3–4-fold higher risk for mortality and cardiovascular events. Interpretation of the pooled estimates has to be done with caution because of heterogeneity across studies.",2009 2009

A phosphate-poor diet markedly increases survival of NPP1 null mice, a model of generalized arterial calcification of infancy. Methods and Results: We performed a multicenter genetic study and retrospective observational analysis of 55 subjects affected by generalized arterial calcification of infancy to identify prognostic factors. Nineteen (34%) patients survived the critical period of infancy. In all 8 surviving patients tested, hypophosphatemia due to reduced renal tubular phosphate reabsorption developed during childhood. Eleven of 17 (65%) patients treated with bisphosphonates survived. Of 26 patients who survived their first day of life and were not treated with bisphosphonates only 8 (31%) patients survived beyond infancy. Forty different homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations, including 16 novel mutations in ENPP1, were found in 41 (75%) of the 55 patients. Twenty-nine (71%) of these 41 patients died in infancy (median, 30 days). Seven of the 14 (50%) patients without ENPP1 mutations died in infancy (median, 9 days). When present on both alleles, the mutation p.P305T was associated with death in infancy in all 5 cases; otherwise, no clear genotype-phenotype correlation was seen. Conclusion: ENPP1 coding region mutations are associated with generalized arterial calcification of infancy in ≈75% of subjects. Except for the p.P305T mutation, which was universally lethal when present on both alleles, the identified ENPP1 mutations per se have no discernable effect on survival. However, survival seems to be associated with hypophosphatemia linked with hyperphosphaturia and also with bisphosphonate treatment.",2008 Dec 1

An 88-year-old woman presented with bilateral breast lumps 4 years after radical nephrectomy for a T2N0M0 renal cancer. Mammography showed a circumscribed 15 mm mass just below and medial to the left nipple without any micro-calcification. Ultrasound scan showed the presence of a solid vascular mass in the left breast; a guided core biopsy confirmed it as a metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Left simple mastectomy and excision of right breast lump was done. Histology of both lesions confirmed them as metastatic deposits. Bilateral breast metastasis from a renal cancer is very rare and this is the second reported case. This case illustrates the potential for rare sites of metastases and for the consideration of metastasis in the presence of previous renal cancer.

813,"Filev P,Hadjiiski L,Chan HP,Sahiner B,Ge J,Helvie MA,Roubidoux M,Zhou C",Automated regional registration and characterization of corresponding microcalcification clusters on temporal pairs of mammograms for interval change analysis.,"A computerized regional registration and characterization system for analysis of microcalcification clusters on serial mammograms is being developed in our laboratory. The system consists of two stages. In the first stage, based on the location of a detected cluster on the current mammogram, a regional registration procedure identifies the local area on the prior that may contain the corresponding cluster. A search program is used to detect cluster candidates within the local area. The detected cluster on the current image is then paired with the cluster candidates on the prior image to form true (TP-TP) or false (TP-FP) pairs. Automatically extracted features were used in a newly designed correspondence classifier to reduce the number of false pairs. In the second stage, a temporal classifier, based on both current and prior information, is used if a cluster has been detected on the prior image, and a current classifier, based on current information alone, is used if no prior cluster has been detected. The data set used in this study consisted of 261 serial pairs containing biopsy-proven calcification clusters. An MQSA radiologist identified the corresponding clusters on the mammograms. On the priors, the radiologist rated the subtlety of 30 clusters (out of the 261 clusters) as 9 or 10 on a scale of 1 (very obvious) to 10 (very subtle). Leave-one-case-out resampling was used for feature selection and classification in both the correspondence and malignant∕benign classification schemes. The search program detected 91.2% (238∕261) of the clusters on the priors with an average of 0.42 FPs∕image. The correspondence classifier identified 86.6% (226∕261) of the TP-TP pairs with 20 false matches (0.08 FPs∕image) relative to the entire set of 261 image pairs. In the malignant∕benign classification stage the temporal classifier achieved a test Az of 0.81 for the 246 pairs which contained a detection on the prior. In addition, a classifier was designed by using the clusters on the current mammograms only. It achieved a test Az of 0.72 in classifying the clusters as malignant and benign. The difference between the performance of the temporal classifier and the current classifier was statistically significant (p=0.0014).

Methods: Three experienced breast radiologists re-reviewed, independently, digital mammography of 97 women with MMBC pathologically diagnosed on surgical specimens. The radiologists were informed of all neoplastic foci, and blinded to the original mammograms and US reports. With regards to Mx, they considered the breast density, number of foci, the Mx characteristics of the lesions and their BI-RADS classification. For US, they considered size of the lesions, BI-RADS classification and US pattern and lesion characteristics. According to the histological size, the lesions were classified as: index cancer, 2nd lesion, 3rd lesion, and 4th lesion. Any pathologically identified malignant foci not previously described in the original imaging reports, were defined as undetected or missed lesions. Sensitivity was calculated for Mx, US and re-reviewed Mx for detecting the presence of the index cancer as well as additional satellite lesions. Results: Pathological examination revealed 13 multifocal and 84 multicentric cancers with a total of 303 malignant foci (282 invasive and 21 non invasive). Original Mx and US reports had an overall sensitivity of 45.5% and 52.9%, respectively. Mx detected 83/97 index cancers with a sensitivity of 85.6%. The number of lesions undetected by original Mx was 165/303. The Mx pattern of breasts with undetected lesions were: fatty in 3 (1.8%); scattered fibroglandular density in 40 (24.3%), heterogeneously dense in 91 (55.1%) and dense in 31 (18.8%) cases. In breasts with an almost entirely fatty pattern, Mx sensitivity was 100%, while in fibroglandular or dense pattern it was reduced to 45.5%. Re-reviewed Mx detected only 3 additional lesions. The sensitivity of Mx was affected by the presence of dense breast tissue which obscured lesions or by an incorrect interpretation of suspicious findings.US detected 73/80 index cancers (sensitivity of 91.2%), US missed 117 malignant foci with a mean tumor diameter of 6.5 mm; the sensitivity was 52.9%Undetected lesions by US were those smallest in size and present in fatty breast or in the presence of microcalcifications without a visible mass.US sensitivity was affected by the presence of fatty tissue or by the extent of calcification. Conclusion: Mx missed MMBC malignant foci more often in dense or fibroglandular breasts. US missed small lesions in mainly fatty breasts or when there were only microcalcifications. The combined sensitivity of both techniques to assess MMBC was 58%. We suggest larger studies on multimodality imaging.",2008

We report an analysis of 20 cases of ovarian involvement by metastatic colorectal adenocarcinomas and colorectal involvement by metastatic ovarian adenocarcinomas, including the value of differential expression of cytokeratins 7 & 20 by immunohistochemistry (IHC), in these cases. Nine cases (45%) were identified as colorectal adenocarcinomas metastatic to the ovary. On biopsy, all these cases showed a 'garland-like' tumor necrosis, with desmoplasia and predominantly exhibited a tubuloalveolar pattern (67% cases). On IHC, all 8 of 9 such cases, where staining for cytokeratin 20 was performed, displayed strong positivity and 7 cases, where staining for carcinoembryogenic antigen (CEA) was performed, revealed positivity for this marker (100%). Other 11 cases (55%) were ovarian adenocarcinomas, metastatic to the colorectum. These showed metachronous presentations, with the ovarian tumor preceding the colorectal tumor deposits. Morphologically, psammomatous calcification was noted in 73% of these cases, whereas 'garland-like' necrosis was absent in all. The chief morphological subtype was serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma (55% cases). On IHC, CK7 and CA 125 were positive in all 6 of 11 such cases, whereas CK 20 was negative in all these cases.In cases of complex presentations like an ovarian involvement by a metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma and vice-versa, certain clinicopathological features are useful. Differential expression of CK 7 and CK20 is vital in resolving these dilemmas. CK20 positivity and CK7 negativity is associated with a colorectal adenocarcinoma. Markers like CEA and CA-125 have an added value.",2008

It is typically a poor prognosis tumour, which has some interesting features worthy of discussion. We report a case of primary osteosarcoma of the breast and summarise the previous medical literature to highlight several details of this unusual tumour. Case presentation: A 66-year-old Caucasian lady presented with painless lump in her right breast. Mammography showed features of fibroadenoma with calcification and fine needle aspiration cytology was reported as showing malignant cells (C5). Wide local excision was performed and histological features were consistent with primary osteosarcoma with predominance of osteoclastic activity. Subsequent completion mastectomy was performed because of suspicion of incomplete excision. She remains disease free 8 years from her initial surgery.",2008

We have isolated tumor endothelial cells from mice which spontaneously develop prostate tumors. Clonal populations of tumor endothelial cells expressed hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cell markers and differentiated to form cartilage and bone-like tissues. Chondrogenic differentiation was accompanied by an up-regulation of cartilage-specific col 2a1 and sox 9, whereas osteocalcin and the metastasis marker osteopontin were up-regulated during osteogenic differentiation. In human and mouse prostate tumors, ectopic vascular calcification was predominately luminal and co-localized with the endothelial marker CD31. Thus, prostate tumor endothelial cells are atypically multi-potent and can undergo a mesenchymal-like transition.",2008 Sep 9
818,"Kappadath SC,Shaw CC",Dual-energy digital mammography for calcification imaging: noise reduction techniques.,"We have previously developed a dual-energy digital mammography (DEDM) technique for calcification imaging under full-field imaging conditions using a commercially available flat-panel based digital mammography system. Although dual-energy (DE) imaging could suppress the obscuration of calcifications by tissue-structure background, it also increases the intrinsic noise in the DE images. Here we report on the effects of three different noise reduction techniques on DE calcification images: a simple smoothing (boxcar) filter applied to the DE image, a median filter applied to the HE image prior to the computation of the DE image and an adaptation of the Kalender’s correlated-noise reduction (KNR) technique for DEDM. We compared the different noise reduction techniques by evaluating their effects on DE calcification images of a 5 cm thick breast-tissue-equivalent slab with continuously varying glandular-tissue ratio superimposed with calcium carbonate crystals of various sizes that simulate calcifications. Evaluations of different noise reducing techniques were performed by comparison of the root-mean-square signal in background regions (no calcifications present) of the DE calcification images and the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of the calcifications in the DE calcification images. Amongst the different noise reduction techniques evaluated in this study, the KNR method was found to be most effective in reducing the image noise and increasing the calcification visibility (or CNR), closely followed by the HE median filter technique. Although the simple smoothing (boxcar) filter reduced the noise, it did not improve calcification visibility. The visible calcification threshold size with DEDM over smoothly varying background at screening mammography doses, assuming a CNR threshold of 4, was estimated to be around 250 μm with both the HE median filter and the KNR techniques. The quality of DE images with noise reduction techniques based on phantom studies were verified with DE images of an animal-tissue phantom that consisted of calcifications superimposed over more realistic tissue structures.",2008 Oct 7

Methods: Local research ethics committee approval was obtained; informed consent was not required. Mammograms were obtained from women attending routine mammography at two breast screening centres in 1996. Films, previously double read, were re-read by a different reader using CAD. The study material included 315 cancer cases comprising all screen-detected cancer cases, all subsequent interval cancers and 861 normal cases randomly selected from 10,267 cases. Ground truth data were used to assess the efficacy of CAD prompting. Associations between prompt attributes and tumour features or reader recall decisions were assessed by chi-squared tests. Results: There was a highly significant relationship between prompting and a decision to recall for cancer cases and for a random sample of normal cases (P < 0.001). Sixty-four per cent of all cases contained at least one CAD prompt. In cancer cases, larger prompts were more likely to be recalled (P = 0.02) for masses but there was no such association for calcifications (P = 0.9). In a random sample of 861 normal cases, larger prompts were more likely to be recalled (P = 0.02) for both mass and calcification prompts. Significant associations were observed with prompting and breast density (p = 0.009) for cancer cases but not for normal cases (P = 0.05). Conclusions: For both normal cases and cancer cases, prompted mammograms were more likely to be recalled and the prompt size was also associated with a recall decision.",2008
820,"Calisir C,Yavas US,Erol N",The Relationship between the Breast Arterial Calcification Detected by Mammography and the Hypertensive Retinopathy in Hypertensive Women.,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the breast arterial calcification (BAC) detected by mammograms and the hypertensive retinopathy (HR) in hypertensive women who underwent ophthalmologic examination. Materials and Methods: Screening mammography was performed in 99 hypertensive women and these women also underwent an ophthalmologic examination. The presence of arterial calcification and the number of calcified blood vessels in each breast were evaluated. The grade of HR was determined. The presence of BAC and the number of blood vessels involved was compared according to the presence of HR and the grade of HR. Results: Among the 99 patients, HR was detected in 70 patients, and of these 70 patients, 42 patients had grade I HR and 28 had grade II HR. BAC was detected in 54 cases. Forty-six patients with HR (66%) and eight patients without HR (27%) were diagnosed with BAC after they underwent mammographic examination. The prevalence of BAC in the subjects who had HR was statistically higher than that in those subjects who did not have HR (p < 0.01). The grade of HR was not significantly associated with BAC (p > 0.05). The positive predictive value of the BAC detected on mammography for HR was 0.80 in those subjects who were ≥ 60 years old. Conclusion: The detection of BAC by mammography is associated with an increased risk of HR, and particularly for patients after the age of 60. The findings of BAC may be related to hypertensive end-organ damage, and performing mammograms might contribute to predicting the presence of ophthalmologic hypertensive complications in these patients.",2008 Aug

Background: Marine-derived n-3 FAs at low levels are cardioprotective through their anti-arrhythmic effect. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study in 281 Japanese, 306 White, and 281 Japanese American men aged 40–49 was conducted to assess intima-media thickness of the carotid artery (IMT), coronary artery calcification (CAC), and serum FAs. Results: Japanese in Japan had the lowest levels of atherosclerosis whereas Whites and Japanese Americans had similar levels. Japanese in Japan had twofold higher levels of marine-derived n-3 FAs than Whites and Japanese Americans. Japanese in Japan had significant and non-significant inverse associations of marine-derived n-3 FAs with IMT and CAC prevalence, respectively. The significant inverse association with IMT remained after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Neither Whites nor Japanese Americans had such associations. Significant differences between Japanese in Japan and Whites in multivariable-adjusted IMT (mean difference 39 μm (95% confidence interval (CI), 21 to 57), p<0.001) and CAC prevalence (mean difference 10.7% (95% CI, 2.9 to 18.4), p=0.007) became non-significant after further adjusting for marine-derived n-3 FAs (22 μm (95% CI, −1 to 46), p=0.065 and 5.0 % (95% CI, −5.3 to 15.4), p=0.341, respectively).

Indeed, there is presently no short-latency, high-yield, syngeneic rodent model of the process. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is a key mediator of physiological bone formation and pathological vasculature calcification, but its role in breast cancer microcalcification is unknown. In this study, R3230 rat breast tumors were adapted to cell culture, transduced with adenoviral BMP-2, and inoculated into a syngeneic host. Tumor growth and calcium salt deposition were quantified in living animals over time using micro-computed tomography, and probed chemically using near-infrared fluorescence. Plasma BMP-2 levels were quantified over time by ELISA. Within three weeks, 100% of breast tumors developed microcalcifications, which were absent from all normal tissues. Importantly, when two tumors were initiated in a single host, the ipsilateral tumor expressing BMP-2 was able to induce microcalcification in the contralateral tumor that was not expressing BMP-2, suggesting that BMP-2 can act humorally. Taken together, we describe the first reproducible rodent model of breast cancer microcalcification, prove that BMP-2 expression is sufficient for initiating the process, and lay the foundation for a new generation of targeted diagnostic agents.",2008 Jul–Aug
823,"Micheletti RG,Fishbein GA,Currier JS,Singer EJ,Fishbein MC",Calcification of the internal elastic lamina of coronary arteries.,"Two well-recognized patterns of calcification occur in large- and medium-sized arteries, intimal calcification associated with atherosclerosis and medial calcification described by Mönckeberg. Calcification limited to the internal elastic lamina is a third pattern of calcification not previously reported in coronary arteries. Here we describe 19 cases of coronary artery internal elastic lamina calcification. We serially sectioned and examined the coronary arteries of 66 patients with advanced AIDS and 27 HIV− controls with other chronic illnesses. We observed calcification of the internal elastic lamina in 10 HIV+ patients and 9 controls. HIV− patients with internal elastic lamina calcification were significantly older than HIV− patients without it (P = 0.008) and HIV+ patients with it (P = 0.006). Occasionally, calcification encroached on adjacent intimal or medial tissue with mild fibrosis. There was frequent disruption of the internal elastic lamina but no evidence of inflammation. Calcification was the dominant histologic feature in all cases. Von Kossa, Alizarin red, and trichrome/elastic stains confirmed these findings. Patients with internal elastic lamina calcification often had extensive medical histories but did not suffer from chronic renal failure or other conditions known to cause calcium dysregulation. We describe coronary internal elastic lamina calcification in HIV+ patients and older HIV− adults. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. It could lead to arterial stiffening and increased pulse pressure and could be mistaken for intimal calcification on coronary imaging. Internal elastic lamina calcification may result from premature aging due to HIV disease and chronic illness or from metabolic disorders in HIV+ patients.",2008 Aug

However, it is unclear if these nanoparticles participate in disease processes. Therefore, this study was designed to preliminarily test the hypothesis that human-derived nanoparticles are causal to arterial disease processes. One carotid artery of 3 kg male rabbits was denuded of endothelium; the contralateral artery remained unoperated as a control. Each rabbit was injected intravenously with either saline, calcified, or decalcified nanoparticles cultured from calcified human arteries or kidney stones. After 35 days, both injured and control arteries were removed for histological examination. Injured arteries from rabbits injected with saline showed minimal, eccentric intimal hyperplasia. Injured arteries from rabbits injected with calcified kidney stone- and arterial-derived nanoparticles occluded, sometimes with canalization. The calcified kidney stone-derived nanoparticles caused calcifications within the occlusion. Responses to injury in rabbits injected with decalcified kidney stone-derived nanoparticles were similar to those observed in saline-injected animals. However, decalcified arterial-derived nanoparticles produced intimal hyperplasia that varied from moderate to occlusion with canalization and calcification. This study offers the first evidence that there may be a causal relationship between human-derived nanoparticles and response to injury including calcification in arteries with damaged endothelium.",2008 Jun

They comprise less than 1% of pancreatic and periampullay tumors. The clinical presentation of these tumors are varied. It is usually a large, encapsulated mass with area of hemorrhage and necrosis or calcification. Pancreatoblastoma can present as abdominal pain, abdominal mass, diarrhea, or upper gastrointestinal bleeding but most of the time they are asymptomatic. The presenting features are highly non-specific and that may leads to diagnostic dilemmas. Case Report:: A 19-year old female presented to our hospital with history of upper abdominal pain and lump in the epigastric region for one year. Physical examination revealed a large lump in epigastric region with mild tenderness. Routine blood counts were within normal ranges. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a large, well defined, heterogeneous mass in the region of head of the pancreas with foci of discrete calcifications. Pancreatic head was not separately identified from the lesion. The plain CT scan revealed a large soft tissue density mass lesion with foci of calcification in the head of the pancreas. Post contrast image shows heterogeneous enhancement. USG guided FNAC of the mass was done and findings was suggestive of pancreatoblastoma. Patient underwent laparotomy and resection of the mass and histopathological result was pancreatoblastoma. Conclusion:: Pancreatoblastoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an upper abdominal mass in a child, especially when the mass appears to arise from the pancreas or liver.",2008 May
826,"Seo Y,Aparici CM,Hasegawa BH",Technological Development and Advances in SPECT/CT.,"SPECT/CT has emerged over the past decade as a means of correlating anatomical information from CT with functional information from SPECT. The integration of SPECT and CT in a single imaging device facilitates anatomical localization of the radiopharmaceutical to differentiate physiological uptake from that associated with disease and patient-specific attenuation correction to improve the visual quality and quantitative accuracy of the SPECT image. The first clinically available SPECT/CT systems performed emission-transmission imaging using a dual-headed SPECT camera and a low-power x-ray CT sub-system. Newer SPECT/CT systems are available with high-power CT sub-systems suitable for detailed anatomical diagnosis, including CT coronary angiography and coronary calcification that can be correlated with myocardial perfusion measurements. The high-performance CT capabilities also offer the potential to improve compensation of partial volume errors for more accurate quantitation of radionuclide measurement of myocardial blood flow and other physiological processes and for radiation dosimetry for radionuclide therapy. In addition, new SPECT technologies are being developed that significantly improve the detection efficiency and spatial resolution for radionuclide imaging of small organs including the heart, brain, and breast, and therefore may provide new capabilities for SPECT/CT imaging in these important clinical applications.",2008 May

Detailed radiological–pathological review of 47 patients with cores showing classical lobular neoplasia was performed (patients with pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or associated risk lesions were considered separately). Immediate surgical excision in 25 patients showed invasive carcinoma in 7, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in 1 and pleomorphic LCIS in 1; radiological–pathological review showed that the core biopsy missed a mass in 5, missed calcification in 2 and that calcification appeared adequately sampled in 2. Nineteen patients had follow-up of at least 2 years. Four patients developed malignancy at the site of the core biopsy (invasive carcinoma in three, DCIS in one); one carcinoma was mammographically occult, one patient had dense original mammograms and two had calcifications apparently adequately sampled by the core. In conclusion, most carcinomas identified at the site of core biopsy showing lobular neoplasia were the result of the core missing the radiological lesion, emphasising the importance of multidisciplinary review and investigation of any discordance. Some carcinomas were found after apparently adequate core biopsy, raising the question of whether excision biopsy should be considered after all core biopsy diagnoses of lobular neoplasia.",2008 May
828,"Budoff MJ,Gul KM",Expert review on coronary calcium.,"While there is no doubt that high risk patients (those with >20% ten year risk of future cardiovascular event) need more aggressive preventive therapy, a majority of cardiovascular events occur in individuals at intermediate risk (10%–20% ten year risk). Accurate risk assessment may be helpful in decreasing cardiovascular events through more appropriate targeting of preventive measures. It has been suggested that traditional risk assessment may be refined with the selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) or other methods of subclinical atherosclerosis measurement. Coronary calcification is a marker of atherosclerosis that can be quantified with the use of cardiac CT and it is proportional to the extent and severity of atherosclerotic disease. The published studies demonstrate a high sensitivity of CAC for the presence of coronary artery disease but a lower specificity for obstructive CAD depending on the magnitude of the CAC. Several large clinical trials found clear, incremental predictive value of CAC over the Framingham risk score when used in asymptomatic patients. Based on multiple observational studies, patients with increased plaque burdens (increased CAC) are approximately ten times more likely to suffer a cardiac event over the next 3–5 years. Coronary calcium scores have outperformed conventional risk factors, highly sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) and carotid intima media thickness (IMT) as a predictor of cardiovascular events. The relevant prognostic information obtained may be useful to initiate or intensify appropriate treatment strategies to slow the progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Current data suggests intermediate risk patients may benefit most from further risk stratification with cardiac CT, as CAC testing is effective at identifying increased risk and in motivating effective behavioral changes. This article reviews information pertaining to the clinical use of CAC for assessing coronary atherosclerosis as a useful predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD) in certain population of patients.",2008 Apr

Cervical nodal metastases are common in patients with head and neck cancers, and their assessment is important as it affects treatment planning and prognosis. Neck nodes are also a common site of lymphomatous involvement and an accurate diagnosis is essential as its treatment differs from other causes of neck lymphadenopathy. On ultrasound, grey scale sonography helps to evaluate nodal morphology, whilst power Doppler sonography is used to assess the vascular pattern. Grey scale sonographic features that help to identify metastatic and lymphomatous lymph nodes include size, shape and internal architecture (loss of hilar architecture, presence of intranodal necrosis and calcification). Soft tissue oedema and nodal matting are additional grey scale features seen in tuberculous nodes or in nodes that have been previously irradiated. Power Doppler sonography evaluates the vascular pattern of nodes and helps to identify the malignant nodes. In addition, serial monitoring of nodal size and vascularity are useful features in the assessment of treatment response.",2008
830,"Molloi S,Xu T,Ducote J,Iribarren C",Quantification of breast arterial calcification using full field digital mammography.,"Breast arterial calcification is commonly detected on some mammograms. Previous studies indicate that breast arterial calcification is evidence of general atherosclerotic vascular disease and it may be a useful marker of coronary artery disease. It can potentially be a useful tool for assessment of coronary artery disease in women since mammography is widely used as a screening tool for early detection of breast cancer. However, there are currently no available techniques for quantification of calcium mass using mammography. The purpose of this study was to determine whether it is possible to quantify breast arterial calcium mass using standard digital mammography. An anthropomorphic breast phantom along with a vessel calcification phantom was imaged using a full field digital mammography system. Densitometry was used to quantify calcium mass. A calcium calibration measurement was performed at each phantom thickness and beam energy. The known (K) and measured (M) calcium mass on 5 and 9 cm thickness phantoms were related by M=0.964K−0.288 mg (r=0.997 and SEE=0.878 mg) and M=1.004K+0.324 mg (r=0.994 and SEE=1.32 mg), respectively. The results indicate that accurate calcium mass measurements can be made without correction for scatter glare as long as careful calcium calibration is made for each breast thickness. The results also indicate that composition variations and differences of approximately 1 cm between calibration phantom and breast thickness introduce only minimal error in calcium measurement. The uncertainty in magnification is expected to cause up to 5% and 15% error in calcium mass for 5 and 9 cm breast thicknesses, respectively. In conclusion, a densitometry technique for quantification of breast arterial calcium mass was validated using standard full field digital mammography. The results demonstrated the feasibility and potential utility of the densitometry technique for accurate quantification of breast arterial calcium mass using standard digital mammography.",2008 Apr

We assessed the hypothesis that selective estrogen receptor modulation induces plaque stability in “menopausal” animals. Methods and Results: Atherosclerosis was induced in 42 ovariectomized New Zealand White rabbits by cholesterol feeding and mechanical injury. Animals were imaged by magnetic resonance (MRI) for baseline atherosclerosis, and randomized to control (OVX, n=12), raloxifene 35–60 mg/kg/day by diet admixture (RLX, n=24), or immediate sacrifice (n=6) for immunohistopathologic correlation of MRI. Six months later, rabbits underwent repeat MRI then sacrifice for micro-computed tomography (μCT) and molecular analysis. Unlike OVX, RLX reduced atheroma volume. Analysis for lesion inflammation revealed reductions in COX-2, MMP-1, MCP-1 expression and macrophage infiltration in RLX vs. OVX with concomitant upregulation of estrogen receptor α. μCT showed similar total vascular calcification between groups, but calcifications in RLX were less nodular with better radial organization (mean calcific arc angle 63 ± 7° vs. 33 ± 6° in OVX), the predicted result of a 53% increase in BMP-2. Conclusions: Raloxifene treatment results in reduced lesion volume, enhanced mechanical stability of vascular calcification, and less inflamed lesions characterized by less macrophage infiltration and reduced COX-2, MMP-1 and MCP-1 expression.",2008 Nov
832,Kwag HJ,Imaging Findings of Implanted Absorbable Mesh in Patients with Breast Partial Resection.,"Purpose: The author presents imaging findings of patients that underwent partial resection of the breast followed by absorbable mesh implantation. Materials and Methods: Ultrasonographic (n = 18) and mammographic (n = 11) images of patients that had undergone absorbable mesh implantation after breast partial resection were reviewed retrospectively. Sequential changes of the lesions were analyzed in follow-up ultrasonographic examinations, focusing on the change of the size and pattern of the lesion. The presence of a mass, asymmetry, focal asymmetry, architectural distortion, and calcification were evaluated by mammography. Pathologic findings of the implanted mesh in available cases were analyzed. Results: Ultrasonograms revealed a well-encapsulated anechoic lesion with (pattern 1, n = 11) or without (pattern 2, n = 5) internal isoechoic nodular portion, and a hyperechoic mass-like lesion without anechoic portion (pattern 3, n = 2). The mean length of the longest diameter decreased gradually as determined in follow-up examinations (3 months, 6.12 ± 2.599 cm; 6 months, 5.08 ± 2.105 cm; 12 months, 3.26 ± 2.206 cm). In mammograms, a mass (n = 4) was noted at the surgical site and focal asymmetry, overlapping with the postoperative change, was seen in the remaining seven cases. Pathologic findings of two cases revealed foreign body reaction. Conclusion: Ultrasonography of the patients that underwent breast partial resection followed by absorbable mesh implantation showed a well-encapsulated cyst at the surgical site that gradually decreased in follow-up examinations. Adjunctive ultrasonography combined with mammography would be recommended in postoperative follow-up examinations.",2008 Feb 29
833,"Reddy J,Bilezikian JP,Smith SJ,Mosca L",Reduced Bone Mineral Density Is Associated with Breast Arterial Calcification.,"Background: Arterial calcification, a marker of atherosclerosis, results from a complex process of biomineralization resembling bone formation. Breast arterial calcification (BAC) has been associated with angiographic and clinical cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and BAC, which may share a common pathophysiology.Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 228 women (55% Hispanic, mean age 64 ±10 yr) who had both mammography and BMD evaluation at Columbia University Medical Center from 2001–2003. Each mammogram was reviewed for the presence of BAC using standardized methods. BMD was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and categorized as normal, low bone density (osteopenia), or osteoporosis as defined by the World Health Organization. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between reduced BMD and BAC.Results: The prevalence of BAC, low bone density (osteopenia), and osteoporosis was 39, 42, and 29%, respectively. Women with BAC were significantly more likely to be older, Hispanic, and postmenopausal and have osteoporosis as compared with women without BAC. In age-adjusted analyses, women with BAC were more likely to have reduced BMD (odds ratio 3.0, P < 0.01) as compared with women without BAC. Furthermore, osteoporosis was strongly associated with the presence of BAC (odds ratio 3.5, P < 0.01).Conclusion: These data suggest that osteoporosis and arterial calcification are strongly and independently correlated. Reduced BMD may identify women at risk of vascular disease.",2008 Jan
834,"Boyce BF,Xing L","Biology of RANK, RANKL, and osteoprotegerin.","The discovery of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)/RANK/osteoprotegerin (OPG) system and its role in the regulation of bone resorption exemplifies how both serendipity and a logic-based approach can identify factors that regulate cell function. Before this discovery in the mid to late 1990s, it had long been recognized that osteoclast formation was regulated by factors expressed by osteoblast/stromal cells, but it had not been anticipated that members of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of ligands and receptors would be involved or that the factors involved would have extensive functions beyond bone remodeling. RANKL/RANK signaling regulates the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts from their precursors as well as their activation and survival in normal bone remodeling and in a variety of pathologic conditions. OPG protects the skeleton from excessive bone resorption by binding to RANKL and preventing it from binding to its receptor, RANK. Thus, RANKL/OPG ratio is an important determinant of bone mass and skeletal integrity. Genetic studies in mice indicate that RANKL/RANK signaling is also required for lymph node formation and mammary gland lactational hyperplasia, and that OPG also protects arteries from medial calcification. Thus, these tumor necrosis factor superfamily members have important functions outside bone. Although our understanding of the mechanisms whereby they regulate osteoclast formation has advanced rapidly during the past 10 years, many questions remain about their roles in health and disease. Here we review our current understanding of the role of the RANKL/RANK/OPG system in bone and other tissues.",2007

Case presentation: A 67-year-old male presented with blood-tinged stool of 1-month's duration. On colonoscopy, a solid mass was detected protruding from the colon wall. Computed tomography showed a 15 × 9.7 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass, with mottled calcification and a cystic portion, occupying the left upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity. Curative resection of the tumor was performed, and the excised tumor was composed of large multilocular cysts containing old hematomas and necrotic debris. The histology revealed an osteosarcoma showing osteoid formation and blood-filled spaces lined with atypical cells. Despite postoperative chemotherapy, he developed a recurrent peritoneal mass and multiple lung metastases 3 months postoperatively. Conclusion: Given the rarity of cases of mesenteric extraskeletal osteosarcoma, its biologic behavior at this location remains to be determined. However, extraskeletal osteosarcoma with telangiectatic features is an uncommon entity to be recognized because of the possible fatal outcome related to the tumors.",2007

Reproducibility was determined by estimation of mean, absolute, relative difference, the weighted kappa value for agreement and the Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICCC). Results: Fifty-five participants (72.4%) had a coronary calcification of more than zero in Agatston (1.5 mm slice thickness). The reproducibility of coronary calcium measurements between scans in terms of ranking was excellent with Intra-class correlation coefficients of >0.98, and kappa values above 0.80. The absolute difference in calcium score between scans increased with increasing calcium levels, indicating that measurement error increases with increasing calcium levels. However, no relation was found between the mean difference in scores and calcium levels, indicating that the increase in measurement error is likely to result in random misclassification in calcium score. Reproducibility results were similar for 1.5 mm slices and for 3.0 mm slices, and equal for Agatston, volume and mass measurements. Conclusion: Inter-scan reproducibilility of measurement of coronary calcium using images from MDCT is excellent, irrespective of slice thickness and type of calcium parameter.",2007 Apr
837,"Rana RS,Jiang Y,Schmidt RA,Nishikawa RM,Liu B",Independent Evaluation of Computer Classification of Malignant and Benign Calcifications in Full-Field Digital Mammograms.,"Rationale and Objectives: To evaluate whether a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) technique can accurately classify breast calcifications in full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs) as malignant or benign. The computer technique was developed previously on screen-film mammograms (SFMs) in which individual calcifications were identified manually. The present study evaluated the computer technique independently on a new database of FFDM images with automatic detection of the individual calcifications. Materials and Methods: We analyzed 49 consecutive FFDM cases (19 cancers) that showed suspicious calcifications. Four mammography radiologists read softcopy mammograms retrospectively and electronically indicated the region of calcifications in each image. The computer then automatically detected the individual calcifications within the indicated region and analyzed eight features of calcification morphology and distribution to arrive at an estimated likelihood of malignancy. The radiologists entered BI-RADS assessments before and after seeing the computer results. Performance was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Despite variability in radiologist-indicated regions of calcifications, the computer achieved consistently high performance taking input from the four radiologists (ROC curve area, Az, of 0.80, 0.80, 0.78, and 0.77; differences not statistically significant). Previous results showed that the computer technique achieved an Az value of 0.80 on SFMs, which improved radiologists’ performance significantly. Conclusion: The computer technique appears to maintain consistently high performance classifying calcifications in FFDMs as malignant or benign without requiring substantial modification from its initial development on SFMs. The computer performance appears to be robust with respect to variations in radiologists’ input.",2007 Mar
838,"Zhang Y,Chan HP,Sahiner B,Wei J,Goodsitt MM,Hadjiiski LM,Ge J,Zhou C",A comparative study of limited-angle cone-beam reconstruction methods for breast tomosynthesis.,"Digital tomosynthesis mammography (DTM) is a promising new modality for breast cancer detection. In DTM, projection-view images are acquired at a limited number of angles over a limited angular range and the imaged volume is reconstructed from the two-dimensional projections, thus providing three-dimensional structural information of the breast tissue. In this work, we investigated three representative reconstruction methods for this limited-angle cone-beam tomographic problem, including the backprojection (BP) method, the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) and the maximum likelihood method with the convex algorithm (ML-convex). The SART and ML-convex methods were both initialized with BP results to achieve efficient reconstruction. A second generation GE prototype tomosynthesis mammography system with a stationary digital detector was used for image acquisition. Projection-view images were acquired from 21 angles in 3° increments over a ±30° angular range. We used an American College of Radiology phantom and designed three additional phantoms to evaluate the image quality and reconstruction artifacts. In addition to visual comparison of the reconstructed images of different phantom sets, we employed the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), a line profile of features, an artifact spread function (ASF), a relative noise power spectrum (NPS), and a line object spread function (LOSF) to quantitatively evaluate the reconstruction results. It was found that for the phantoms with homogeneous background, the BP method resulted in less noisy tomosynthesized images and higher CNR values for masses than the SART and ML-convex methods. However, the two iterative methods provided greater contrast enhancement for both masses and calcification, sharper LOSF, and reduced inter-plane blurring and artifacts with better ASF behaviors for masses. For a contrast-detail phantom with heterogeneous tissue-mimicking background, the BP method had strong blurring artifacts along the x-ray source motion direction that obscured the contrast-detail objects, while the other two methods can remove the superimposed breast structures and significantly improve object conspicuity. With a properly selected relaxation parameter, the SART method with one iteration can provide tomosynthesized images comparable to those obtained from the ML-convex method with seven iterations, when BP results were used as initialization for both methods.",2006 Oct

Methods: Breast arterial calcifications were studied at baseline and after five years follow-up in 453 women participating in the Raloxifene Use for The Heart (RUTH) study. All mammograms were scored by two observers. With logistic regression analysis the independent effect of risk factors on the progression of BAC was evaluated. Results: BAC was present in 94 of 453 (21%) women at baseline and in 116 of 453 (26%) women after 5.0±1.04 years. Progression of BAC was seen in 44 of 453 (10%) women. In 22 participants (5%) BAC was not present at baseline, while in 22 participants (5%) the severity of BAC merely changed from grade 1 to grade 2 calcification. Age was significantly associated with progression of BAC (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.14). Multivariate regression analysis with adjustment for age and the duration of follow-up showed no association between CHD risk factors and the progression of BAC. Lipid-lowering drugs protected for progression (adjusted OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.98). The strongest determinant in the progression of BAC was BAC at baseline (adjusted OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.10 to 8.27). Conclusion: Progression of BAC is not associated with CHD risk factors, but with increasing age and BAC at baseline. Lipid-lowering drugs protect against progression of BAC.",2006 Sep
840,"Jesneck JL,Nolte LW,Baker JA,Floyd CE,Lo JY",Optimized approach to decision fusion of heterogeneous data for breast cancer diagnosis.,"As more diagnostic testing options become available to physicians, it becomes more difficult to combine various types of medical information together in order to optimize the overall diagnosis. To improve diagnostic performance, here we introduce an approach to optimize a decision-fusion technique to combine heterogeneous information, such as from different modalities, feature categories, or institutions. For classifier comparison we used two performance metrics: The receiving operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve [area under the ROC curve (AUC)] and the normalized partial area under the curve (pAUC). This study used four classifiers: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), artificial neural network (ANN), and two variants of our decision-fusion technique, AUC-optimized (DF-A) and pAUC-optimized (DF-P) decision fusion. We applied each of these classifiers with 100-fold cross-validation to two heterogeneous breast cancer data sets: One of mass lesion features and a much more challenging one of microcalcification lesion features. For the calcification data set, DF-A outperformed the other classifiers in terms of AUC (p<0.02) and achieved AUC=0.85±0.01. The DF-P surpassed the other classifiers in terms of pAUC (p<0.01) and reached pAUC=0.38±0.02. For the mass data set, DF-A outperformed both the ANN and the LDA (p<0.04) and achieved AUC=0.94±0.01. Although for this data set there were no statistically significant differences among the classifiers' pAUC values (pAUC=0.57±0.07 to 0.67±0.05, p>0.10), the DF-P did significantly improve specificity versus the LDA at both 98% and 100% sensitivity (p<0.04). In conclusion, decision fusion directly optimized clinically significant performance measures, such as AUC and pAUC, and sometimes outperformed two wellknown machine-learning techniques when applied to two different breast cancer data sets.",2006 Aug
841,"Kumaraswamy V,Carder PJ",Examination of breast needle core biopsy specimens performed for screen‐detected microcalcification.,"Aims: To establish the number of histological levels necessary for the evaluation of breast needle core biopsy (NCB) specimens taken from areas of mammographic calcification in patients presenting via the UK National Health Service Breast Screening Programme. Methods: Retrospective review of a series of breast NCB specimens initially examined routinely at nine levels. The presence of calcification within the histological sections in each of three sets of levels (levels 1–3, 4–6 and 7–9) and the (cumulative) diagnostic B category that would have pertained after each were assessed. Results: Accurate diagnostic classification was possible after examination of three levels in 89% cases. Examination of a further three levels permitted accurate diagnosis in a further eight cases (total 97% cases). In only three cases were nine levels necessary for accurate classification. In only a single case (1%) was it likely that routine examination of six levels could have led to significant misclassification. In a significant group of patients (18%), nine levels were considered to provide additional useful information, although this information did not alter the diagnosis. Conclusions: NCBs for screen‐detected mammographic calcification should be routinely examined at six levels. Further levels may be needed in occasional cases to identify more conclusively the associated pathological abnormality. Further levels may be of particular value when assessing atypical intraductal proliferative epithelial lesions.",2007 Jun
842,"Johnson ML,Rajamannan N",Diseases of Wnt signaling.,"The Wnt signaling pathways play fundamental roles in the differentiation, proliferation, death and function of many cells and as a result are involved in critical developmental, growth and homeostatic processes in animals. There are four currently known pathways of Wnt signaling; the so-called canonical or Wnt/β-catenin pathway, the Wnt/Ca+2 pathway involving Protein Kinase A, the planar cell polarity pathway and a pathway involving Protein Kinase C that functions in muscle myogenesis. The best studied of these is the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The Wnts are an evolutionarily highly conserved family of genes/proteins. Control of the Wnt pathways is modulated by a number of the proteins that either interact with the Wnt ligands directly, or with the low density lipoprotein-receptor related proteins (LRP) 5 and 6 that along with one of several Frizzled proteins function as co-receptors for the Wnt ligands. Aberrant regulation resulting as a consequence of mutations in any of several components of the Wnt pathway and/or protein modulators of the pathway have been shown to cause a wide spectrum of diseases. This review will briefly touch on various diseases of Wnt signaling including cancer, aortic valve calcification and several bone related phenotypes. Our emerging understanding of Wnt signaling offers great hope that new molecular based screening tests and pharmaceutical agents that selectively target this pathway will be developed to diagnose and treat these diseases in the future.",2006 Jun

Of 48 subjects, however, 45 had an atherosclerosis-like subendothelial thickening above the elastic lamina on the aortic side of at least one of the valve leaflets. Of 15 young subjects aged 20–40 years, eight had a lesion in the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve and 12 had a lesion in at least one of the three aortic valve leaflets. Of 17 middle aged subjects, 16 had an early lesion in the right coronary cusp and all had a lesion in at least one of the valve leaflets. In the oldest age group, all 16 subjects had a lesion in every valve leaflet. The mean lesion area in the three valve leaflets varied from 0.1–0.2 mm2 in young subjects, 0.5–0.8 mm2 in middle aged, and 1.3–2.3 mm2 in elderly subjects (p < 0.001). Microscopic calcification in the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve was observed in 12 of 17 middle aged and 14 of 16 elderly subjects but only in one young subject.Conclusions: Atherosclerosis-like lesions in the aortic valve are prevalent in adults of all age groups, including young subjects aged 20–40 years, suggesting that the disease process leading to aortic stenosis is common, often beginning in early adulthood.",2005 May

Each of the above contributes to an accelerated and premature demise primarily due to cardiovascular disease. The above conditions are associated with multiple metabolic toxicities resulting in an increase in reactive oxygen species to the arterial vessel wall, which results in a response to injury wound healing (remodeling). The endothelium seems to be at the very center of these disease processes, acting as the first line of defense against these multiple metabolic toxicities and the first to encounter their damaging effects to the arterial vessel wall. Results: The pathobiomolecular mechanisms of vascular calcification are presented in order to provide the clinician – researcher a database of knowledge to assist in the clinical management of these high-risk patients and examine newer therapies. Calciphylaxis is associated with medial arteriolar vascular calcification and results in ischemic subcutaneous necrosis with vulnerable skin ulcerations and high mortality. Recently, this clinical syndrome (once thought to be rare) is presenting with increasing frequency. Consequently, newer therapeutic modalities need to be explored. Intravenous sodium thiosulfate is currently used as an antidote for the treatment of cyanide poisioning and prevention of toxicities of cisplatin cancer therapies. It is used as a food and medicinal preservative and topically used as an antifungal medication. Conclusion: A discussion of sodium thiosulfate's dual role as a potent antioxidant and chelator of calcium is presented in order to better understand its role as an emerging novel therapy for the clinical syndrome of calciphylaxis and its complications.",2005

In addition to acute toxicity, Pb has an extremely long half-life in bone. Individuals with past exposure develop increased blood Pb levels during periods of high bone turnover or resorption. Pb is known to affect osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes and has been associated with osteoporosis. However, its effects on skeletal repair have not been studied. We exposed C57/B6 mice to various concentrations of Pb acetate in their drinking water to achieve environmentally relevant blood Pb levels, measured by atomic absorption. After exposure for 6 weeks, each mouse underwent closed tibia fracture. Radiographs were followed and histologic analysis was performed at 7, 14, and 21 days. In mice exposed to low Pb concentrations, fracture healing was characterized by a delay in bridging cartilage formation, decreased collagen type II and type X expression at 7 days, a 5-fold increase in cartilage formation at day 14 associated with delayed maturation and calcification, and a persistence of cartilage at day 21. Fibrous nonunions at 21 days were prevalent in mice receiving very high Pb exposures. Pb significantly inhibited ex vivo bone nodule formation but had no effect on osteoclasts isolated from Pb-exposed animals. No significant effects on osteoclast number or activity were observed. We conclude that Pb delays fracture healing at environmentally relevant doses and induces fibrous nonunions at higher doses by inhibiting the progression of endochondral ossification.",2005 Jun

Laboratory findings suggested rhabdomyolysis complicated with acute renal failure. A diagnosis of polymyositis was based upon the proximal muscle weakness on both upper and lower limbs, elevated muscle enzyme levels, muscle biopsy findings and the needle electromyography findings. The muscle biopsy showed extensive muscle necrosis and calcification. Investigations for underlying malignancy demonstrated hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was managed with hemodialysis and high dose prednisolone. His renal function was fully recovered and his muscle power did improve slightly, but he died of a rupture of the hepatic tumor. In our view, this is an interesting case in that the hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with polymyositis and fulminant rhabdomyolysis-induced acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis.",2004 Dec
847,"Hsia J,Klouj A,Prasad A,Burt J,Adams-Campbell LL,Howard BV",Progression of coronary calcification in healthy postmenopausal women.,"Background: Coronary artery calcium score incrementally improves coronary risk prediction beyond that provided by conventional risk factors. Limited information is available regarding rates of progression of coronary calcification in women, particularly those with baseline scores above zero. Further, determinants of progression of coronary artery calcification in women are not well understood. This study prospectively evaluated rates and determinants of progression of coronary artery calcium score in a group of healthy postmenopausal women. Methods: We determined coronary calcium score by computed tomography and recorded demographic, lifestyle and health characteristics of 914 postmenopausal women, a subset of those enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. The 305 women with calcium score ≥10 Agatston units at baseline were invited for repeat scan. This analysis includes the 94 women who underwent second scans. Results: Mean age of study participants was 65 ± 9 years (mean ± SD), body mass index was 26.1 ± 6.1 kg/m2, and baseline calcium score was 162 ± 220 Agatston units. Mean interval between scans was 3.3 ± 0.7 years. A wide range of changes in coronary calcium score was observed, from -53 to +452 Agatston units/year. Women with lower scores at baseline had smaller annual increases in absolute calcium score. Coronary calcium scores increased 11, 31 and 79 Agatston units/year among women with baseline calcium score in the lowest, middle and highest tertiles. In multivariate analysis, age was not an independent predictor of absolute change in coronary calcium score. Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) use at baseline was a negative predictor (p = 0.015), whereas baseline calcium score was a strong, positive predictor (p < 0.0001) of progression of coronary calcification. Conclusion: Among postmenopausal women with coronary calcium score ≥ 10 Agatston units, rates of change of coronary calcium score varied widely. In multivariate analysis, statin use was a negative independent determinant, whereas baseline calcium score was a strong positive predictor of annual change in coronary calcium score.",2004
848,"Yamamoto D,Yamada M,Okugawa H,Tanaka K",Predicting invasion in mammographically detected microcalcifcation: a preliminary report.,"Background: With the increased use of mammography for breast cancer screening, the diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) too has increased. This study was carried out to identify clinical and radiological factors that may predict the presence of invasive disease within mammographically detected microcalcifcation. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of 13 vacuum-assisted breast biopsies (Mammotome®) of mammographic calcification, which were reported to be either DCIS or invasive disease on final histopathology, was carried out. Final surgical pathology was correlated with pre-operative features (clinical, radiological and core histology) to predict the presence of an invasive component. Results: The overall sensitivity of Mammotome® was 81.8%, while for invasion it was 50%. Small size, granular morphology, increased number and area of calcification cluster may help in predicting invasion on mammography. Conclusions: Mammotome® biopsy fails to detect invasion correctly in half the cases despite ascertaining correctness of biopsy with post biopsy x-ray.",2004

The aims of this study were to determine if the type of calcification can be best used to predict histopathological grade from the mammograms, to examine the association of mammographic appearance of DCIS with grade and to assess the correlation between mammographic size and pathological size. Methods: Mammographic films and pathological slides of 115 patients treated for DCIS between 1986 and 2000 were reviewed and reclassified by a single radiologist and a single pathologist respectively. Prediction models for the European Pathologist Working Group (EPWG) and Van Nuys classifications were generated by ordinal regression. The association between mammographic appearance and grade was tested with the χ2-test. Relation of mammographic size with pathological size was established using linear regression. The relation was expressed by the correlation coefficient (r). Results: The EPWG classification was correctly predicted in 68%, and the Van Nuys classification in 70% if DCIS was presented as microcalcifications. High grade was associated with presence of linear calcifications (p < 0.001). Association between mammograhic- and pathological size was better for DCIS presented as microcalcifications (r = 0.89, p < 0.001) than for DCIS presented as a density (r = 0.77, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Prediction of histopathological grade of DCIS presenting as microcalcifications is comparable using the Van Nuys and EPWG classification. There is no strict association of mammographic appearance with histopathological grade. There is a better linear relation between mammographic- and pathological size of DCIS presented as microcalcifications than as a density, although both relations are statistically significant.",2004

Here we identify the serum protein α2–Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (Ahsg, also known as fetuin-A) as an important inhibitor of ectopic calcification acting on the systemic level. Ahsg-deficient mice are phenotypically normal, but develop severe calcification of various organs on a mineral and vitamin D–rich diet and on a normal diet when the deficiency is combined with a DBA/2 genetic background. This phenotype is not associated with apparent changes in calcium and phosphate homeostasis, but with a decreased inhibitory activity of the Ahsg-deficient extracellular fluid on mineral formation. The same underlying principle may contribute to many calcifying disorders including calciphylaxis, a syndrome of severe systemic calcification in patients with chronic renal failure. Taken together, our data demonstrate a critical role of Ahsg as an inhibitor of unwanted mineralization and provide a novel therapeutic concept to prevent ectopic calcification accompanying various diseases.",2003 Aug 1

Thirty-one of our patients were men (73.8%) and 11 were women (26.2%); their average age was 39.3 years. The pericarditis was tuberculous in 24 patients (57.1%), idiopathic in 10 (23.8%), rheumatic in 4 (9.5%), uremic in 2 (4.8%), and neoplastic in 2 (4.8%).In all cases, our approach was via median sternotomy. All anterior pericardium was resected from phrenic nerve to phrenic nerve. In 4 of 18 patients with calcific pericardial plaques, we could not develop a cleavage plane, so we left the plaques in place, reducing their size and relieving constriction by means of wedge incisions that reached the epicardium. No patient required cardiopulmonary bypass due to severe calcification or adhesion, but we did perform bypass with no difficulty in 5 patients who required additional cardiac surgery.The early postoperative mortality rate was 11.9% (5 patients). In the 1st postoperative month, functional capacity improved dramatically: the number of patients in New York Heart Association functional class IV moved from 18 (preoperatively) to 1; in class III, from 20 to 6; in class II, from 4 to 13; and in class I, from 0 to 22. We recommend the median sternotomy approach for chronic constrictive pericarditis and consider cardiopulmonary bypass safe to use in indicated cases. (Tex Heart Inst J 2003;30:27–30)",2003
